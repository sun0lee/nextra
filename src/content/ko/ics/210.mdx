  - b.	Longevity risk: risk of losses due to actual mortality rates lower than expected;
  - c.	Morbidity/Disability risk: risk of losses due to unexpected changes in the level, trend or volatility of disability, sickness and morbidity rates;
  - d.	Lapse risk: risk of losses due to unexpected changes in the level or volatility of rates of policy lapses, terminations, renewals and surrenders;
  - e.	Expense risk: risk of losses due to unexpected changes in the incidence of expense incurred.

### 2.1.3	Calibration of risks

###### 13
<G2Col>
<div>
  To inform the calibration of Life risks, supplementary data collections were run in 2018, 2019 and 2022, together with the Field Testing / confidential reporting data collections. In the context of those supplementary Life data collections, Volunteer Groups were requested to provide data covering at least 10 consecutive years (in 2018 and 2019), and 13 consecutive years (in 2022).

###### 16
<G2Col>
<div>
  In 2018 and 2019, data were collected from IAIGs in order to inform a potential refinement of the calibration. Based on those data and on the assumption that the variable <GTooltip label="𝐴/𝐸 − 1" desc="(where 𝐴 and 𝐸 respectively denote actual and expected claims, due to all causes, incurred in each financial year)"/> follows a normal distribution (for which observations are independent and identically distributed), the following 99.5th percentiles<GTooltipIcon desc="In practice, the 99.5th percentiles were determined as 2.58 times the historical standard deviation calculated for the 𝐴/𝐸 − 1 variable."/> were calculated for mortality rates:
    - a. 6% for business written in Japan;
    - b. 15% for business written in China; and
    - c. 10% for business written in other developed markets.

   - c. 기타 선진시장: 10%
</div>
</G2Col>

###### 17
<G2Col>
<div>
  Data for the Japanese market were considered sufficient evidence, with over 10 years of history; therefore, it was decided to set the stress factor for business written in Japan to 10% (including a prudence margin based on expert judgement). The appropriateness of that level was confirmed by data collected in 2022.
</div>
<div>
  일본 시장의 경우, 10년 이상의 데이터가 확보되었으므로 사망 위험 계수를 10%(전문가 판단 기반 추가 신중성 반영)로 설정함.

</div>
</G2Col>

###### 18
<G2Col>
<div>
  For business written in China, the 2019 and 2022 data collections provided evidence of a risk factor between 13% and 27%; the risk factor was therefore set to 15%.
</div>
<div>
  중국 시장의 경우, 2019·2022년 데이터에서 위험 계수가 13\~27% 범위로 관측됨.

</div>
</G2Col>

###### 20
<G2Col>
<div>
  For US and Canada and other emerging markets, the lack of historical data provided in all data collections did not allow for an adjustment of the calibration. Therefore, based on expert judgement the stress factor was aligned with other developed markets (12.5%).
</div>
<div>
  미국·캐나다 및 기타 신흥시장의 경우, 과거 데이터 부족으로 인해 위험 계수 산출이 어려움.
   - • 전문가 판단을 바탕으로, 해당 시장의 스트레스 계수를 기타 선진시장과 동일한 12.5%로 설정함.
</div>
</G2Col>

###### 21
<G2Col>
<div>
  For EEA and Switzerland, 10 years of historical data collected through the 2019 data collection showed that a 12.5% risk factor was appropriate. Data collected in 2022 continue to support this conclusion.
</div>
<div>
  EEA 및 스위스 시장의 경우, 2019년 데이터(10년 이상 관측치)가 12.5% 위험 계수를 적절한 수준으로 제시함.

</div>
</G2Col>



#### 2.1.3.2	Longevity risk

###### 22
<G2Col>
<div>
  The calculation of the longevity risk charge is based on a scenario of a permanent decrease in mortality rates.
</div>

###### 23

<G2Col>
<div>
  Based on results of data provided by IAIGs for the calibration exercise in 2016, a stress factor of 17.5% across all regions was specified<GTooltipIcon desc="The stress factor was chosen in a way to cover implicitly the trend and volatility components of the longevity risk, since the choice was made not to include explicitly those components in the design. This approach was considered striking an appropriate balance between complexity and risk sensitivity."/> for the 2017 Field Testing. In the absence of any evidence that this level of stress is inappropriate, the 17.5% factor has remained unchanged since then.

#### 2.1.3.3	Morbidity and Disability risk

###### 24

<G2Col>
<div>
  For the calculation of the morbidity/disability risk charge, the business is split:
  - a.	By type of guarantee:
    - i.	Medical expenses (Category 1)
    - ii.	Lump sum in case of a health event (Category 2)
    - iii.	Short-term recurring payments (Category 3)
    - iv.	Long-term recurring payments (Category 4)
  - b.	By term of contract:
    - i.	Short-term (up to 5 years)
    - ii.	Long-term (more than 5 years)

  resulting in eight segments (4 types of guarantee and for each type, 2 terms of contract).
</div>
<div>
  질병/장애 위험 계수 산출 시, 사업을 다음 기준으로 구분함. 총 8개 세그먼트로 분류(4개 보장 유형 × 2개 계약 기간별 구분).

    - i. 의료비 보장 (Category 1)
    - ii. 특정 건강 사건 발생 시 일시금 지급 (Category 2)
    - iii. 단기 분할 지급 (Category 3)
    - iv. 장기 분할 지급 (Category 4)
  - b. 계약 기간별 구분
    - i. 단기(5년 이하)
    - ii. 장기(5년 초과)
</div>
</G2Col>

###### 25
25.	For segments in categories 1 to 3, stress factors are applied either to inception / recovery rates (when those are explicitly used for the modelling of claim costs) or otherwise directly to the expected amount of future claims. For segments in category 4, stress factors are applicable to the assumptions underlying the calculation of future claims (inception rates and recovery rates).

###### 26

26.	The distinction between short-term and long-term contracts was introduced to reflect that claim amounts over a short period are likely more volatile than over a longer period.

###### 27
27.	All stresses are assumed to occur simultaneously, therefore risk charges for those four categories are added together.

##### 2.1.3.3.1	Medical expenses (Category 1)
28.	For short-term contracts, an initial calibration based on 10-year historical data provided by IAIGs was undertaken in 2015. The calibration methodology consisted of calculating, for a number of portfolios, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by average) over time of the following ratios:
a.	number of claims4 per insured people; and
b.	claim amounts to premiums.

29.	The calculated coefficients of variation showed an important heterogeneity and averaged at 12.1% (ratio based on number counts) and 5.3% (ratio based on amounts). Based on those results, a figure of 8% was chosen to represent the typical coefficient of variation for Category 1 products. Under a Gaussian assumption, this 8% coefficient translated into a 21% stress factor (99.5 percentile), which was rounded down to 20%.

30.	For long-term contracts, a calibration was done in 2017 based on an additional data collection from IAIGs, also covering 10 years of history. A 99.5% quantile was calculated based on the historical distribution of claims to gross written premiums. Under a Gaussian assumption, those data provided evidence of a risk factor of 7%. Finally, a margin for prudence was incorporated and an 8% stress factor was set.

##### 2.1.3.3.2	Lump sum in case of a health event (Category 2)
31.	For Category 2 short-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 short- term contracts, based on data collected in 2015. Both sets of ratios showed evidence of an average coefficient of variation close to 8%. However, given the significant variability of those coefficients across portfolios (from 1% to 28%), some conservatism was introduced and a value


4 In this section on Morbidity and Disability risk the term claims encompasses claims due to all causes incurred in a given financial year.
 
of 10% was chosen as a typical coefficient of variation, resulting in a 99.5% stress factor of 26%, rounded down to 25%.

32.	For Category 2 long-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 long-term contracts, based on data collected in 2017. This approach resulted in the choice of a 20% stress factor (30% based on number of policies, 19% based on expected claims).

33.	An additional data analysis conducted in 2018 and 2022 on long-term Category 2 business written in Japan provided evidence supporting a risk factor of 15%.

###### 2.1.3.3.3	Short-term recurring payments (Category 3)

34.	For Category 3 short-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 short- term contracts, based on data collected in 2015. The set of ratios based on the number of insured people showed a coefficient of variation slightly above 8% on average, and 4% for the set based on premiums. Given the high level of discrepancy across portfolios (between 0.7% and 20%, after exclusion of obvious outliers), a typical coefficient of variation was set at 7%, which translated into a stress factor of 18%, rounded up to 20%.

35.	For Category 3 long-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 long-term contracts, based on data collected in 2017. This approach resulted in setting a 12% stress factor (26% based on number of policies, 12% based on expected claims).

36.	The data analyses run in 2018 and 2022 showed evidence that the 99.5% quantile for long-term Category 3 business in Japan was slightly below 10%. Therefore, it was decided to set the stress factor for business written in Japan to 10%.

##### 2.1.3.3.4	Long-term recurring payments (Category 4)

37.	For short-term contracts, the calibration data collected was limited: only one Volunteer Group provided data covering at least 10 consecutive years in 2019, and none in 2022. Therefore, stresses for short-term contracts were determined by reference to Solvency II, which features the same target criteria (99.5% VaR over a one-year time horizon).

38.	For long-term contracts, the same stress factors were chosen as a starting point, and a 20% haircut, based on expert judgement, was applied to the inception rate stress factor to account for a lower volatility of claims over the long run.

#### 2.1.3.4	Lapse risk

39.	The calculation of the lapse risk charge involves three different scenarios:
a.	A permanent increase in future lapse rates (level and trend, up);
b.	A permanent decrease in future lapse rates (level and trend, down); and
c.	An immediate surrender of a fraction of the in-force policies.

40.	For the two scenarios of the level and trend component, an initial placeholder calibration (40% relative increase / decrease in the current estimate lapse rates) was determined based on expert
judgement. Based on a Gaussian assumption for the distribution of the variable 𝐴 − 1 (ratio of
𝐸
actual to expected number of lapses incurred over the financial year), 10-year historical data
submitted by IAIGs in 2018 provided evidence that the 99.5th percentile of lapse rates for business written in Japan should be between 12% and 20%; this evidence was confirmed by the data collected in 2019. Therefore, the stress factor for the level and trend component for business written in Japan was revised to 20%. The data collected in 2019 and 2022 confirmed the appropriateness of the stress factors for Europe, Japan, China and other developed markets. No sufficient data was obtained for other regions.
 


41.	The mass lapse scenario stress factors are 30% (retail policies) and 50% (non-retail). These were determined based on expert judgement after a review of various jurisdictional solvency regimes including those from Solvency II, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Singapore and Japan.

42.	Depending on the portfolio structure, either the mass lapse or the level and trend scenario could be the relevant 0.5% probability scenario for a given IAIG. Therefore, the maximum between those two scenarios is retained as the lapse risk charge. For the same reason, the higher of the level and trend up and level and trend down results is retained as the level and trend component.

#### 2.1.3.5	Expense risk
43.	The calculation of the expense risk charge involves two simultaneous scenarios:
a.	An increase in the unit expense amount by a factor 𝑥;
b.	An increase in the level of inflation of expenses by a factor 𝑦.

44.	An initial placeholder calibration of those two scenarios was chosen by expert judgement and a review of this calibration was undertaken in 2017. This took into account:
a.	The responses to the 2016 ICS public consultation;
b.	9 to 12-year historical data submitted by IAIGs in 2016; and
c.	The Generally Recognised Expense Table (GRET) study published by the Society of Actuaries in the US, based on data from 2008 to 2014.

45.	The review concluded that:
a.	A permanent 3% stress on inflation for China and emerging markets is not realistic, and should be graded down over time;
b.	The order of magnitude of the 𝑥 factor is 10%; and
c.	The global level of 99.5% stress (unit expense + inflation) in the US should be approximately 16%.

46.	In addition, a review based on Field Testing data and conducted in 2018 showed that a 6% factor for unit expense risk in Japan was appropriate.

47.	Based on those considerations, it was decided to introduce a downgrading of the inflation stress after year 10 for Other developed markets, China and Other emerging markets. Other factors were considered globally appropriate. Data collected in 2022 did not provide evidence of calibration inappropriateness.
