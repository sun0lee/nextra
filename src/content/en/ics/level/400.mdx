# 4. Capital resources
## 4.1	General considerations
- L1-48. Qualifying capital resources are determined on a consolidated basis for all financial activities and comprise qualifying financial instruments and capital elements other than financial instruments.
- L1-49. Qualifying capital resources are subject to adjustments, exclusions and deductions, as defined in section 4.4. Any item deducted from capital resources is excluded from the calculation of the ICS capital requirement.
- L1-50.  The ICS identifies two tiers of capital:
    - •	Tier 1 capital resources comprise financial instruments and capital elements, other than financial instruments, that absorb losses on a going-concern basis and in winding-up; and
    - •	Tier 2 capital resources comprise financial instruments and capital elements, other than financial instruments, that absorb losses only in winding-up.
- L1-51. In determining qualifying capital resources, the ICS differentiates between mutual and non- mutual IAIGs.

## 4.2	Classification of financial instruments
- L1-52. Financial instruments are classified into those two tiers based on consideration of a number of criteria, focused on five key principles:
    - •	loss absorbing capacity (on a going-concern basis and/or in winding-up);
    - •	subordination;
    - •	availability to absorb losses;
    - •	permanence; and
    - •	absence of both encumbrances and mandatory servicing costs.
- L1-53. Within each tier, financial instruments are allocated into two categories with differing qualifying criteria:
    - •	Tier 1:
      - o	Tier 1 financial instruments for which there is no limit (Tier 1 Unlimited); and
      - o	Tier 1 financial instruments for which there is a limit (Tier 1 Limited).
    - •	Tier 2:
      - o	Tier 2 Paid-Up financial instruments (Tier 2 Paid-Up); and
      - o	Tier 2 Non-Paid-Up financial instruments (Tier 2 Non-Paid-Up).
- L1-54. Table 3 presents the features of Tier 1 Unlimited, Tier 1 Limited and Tier 2 Paid-Up capital with respect to the classification of financial instruments against the five key principles:

|Key Principle|Tier 1 Unlimited|Teir 1 Limited|Tier2 Paid-Up|
|:--:|--|--|--|
|**Loss absorbing capacity**|Absorbs losses on both a going-concern basis and in winding-up.|Absorbs losses on both a going-concern basis and in winding-up.|Absorbs losses in winding-up.|

<GCaption>Table 3: Key Principles for tiering in capital resources</GCaption>

- L1-55. With regard to Tier 2 Paid-Up capital, the form of subordination can be either contractual or structural. Structurally subordinated instruments are subject to certain conditions that capture the specificities of structural subordination.
- L1-56.  The recognition of Tier 2 Non-Paid-Up capital is restricted to mutual IAIGs. It is also required that once these items become paid-up, the resulting capital element will possess the features required of Tier 1 or Tier 2 Paid-Up capital resources.
- L1-57.  The list of criteria and conditions associated with each tier of capital is specified in the Level 2 text.

<TabPanel header="Tier 1 Unlimited ">
**4.2.1.Tier 1 Unlimited financial instruments**
- L2-111. Financial instruments that meet all of the following criteria qualify as Tier 1 Unlimited capital resources:
    - a. The instrument is fully paid-up.
    - b. The instrument is in the form of issued capital such that it is the first instrument to absorb losses as they occur.
    - c. The instrument represents the most subordinated claim in a winding-up of the IAIG where the holder has a claim on the residual assets proportional to its share of the issued share capital after all other claims have been repaid, and which is not subject to a fixed or capped amount.
    - d. The instrument is perpetual (ie it does not have a maturity date).
    - e. The principal amount of the instrument is not repaid outside winding-up, other than by means of discretionary repurchase permitted under national law.
    - f. There is not an expectation created by the IAIG at issuance, through the terms of the instrument or otherwise, that the IAIG will repurchase or cancel the instrument.
    - g. There are no circumstances under which a distribution is obligatory (non-payment of a distribution is, therefore, not an event of default).
    - h. Distributions are paid out of distributable items, including retained earnings.
    - i. The instrument is neither undermined nor rendered ineffective by encumbrances. In particular, the priority of claims is not compromised by guarantees or security arrangements given by either the IAIG or a related entity over which the IAIG exercises control or significant influence, for the benefit of investors.
    - j. Neither the IAIG nor a related entity over which the IAIG exercises control or significant influence has purchased the instrument, nor has the IAIG directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.
    - k. The paid-in amount is recognised as equity capital (ie is not recognised as a liability) where a determination that liabilities exceed assets constitutes a test of insolvency.
</TabPanel>
<TabPanel header="Tier 1 Limited ">
**4.2.2	Tier 1 Limited financial instruments**
- L2-112. Financial instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 Unlimited capital resources, but meet all of the following criteria, qualify as Tier 1 Limited capital resources:
    - a. The instrument is fully paid-up.
    - b. The instrument is subordinated to policyholders and other non-subordinated creditors and holders of Tier 2 financial instruments but may rank senior to holders of Tier 1 unlimited financial instruments.
    - c. The instrument is perpetual (ie it does not have a maturity date). For mutual IAIGs<GTooltipIcon desc="Characteristics of a mutual group typically include the inability to issue substantial amounts of common equity and an ultimate parent within the group that cannot issue common equity."/>, the requirement for an instrument to be perpetual is considered to be met if redemption at maturity (for a dated instrument) can be deferred subject to supervisory approval or a <GTooltip label="lock-in feature" desc="A lock-in feature is a requirement for the IAIG to suspend repayment or redemption if it is in breach of its applicable regulatory capital requirement or would breach it if the instrument is repaid or redeemed."/>, and where an instrument has an initial maturity of at least ten years.
    - d. The instrument does not contain any incentive to redeem, such as a step-up.
    - e. The instrument is only callable at the option of the issuer after a minimum of five years from the date of issue and prior supervisory approval is required for any redemption. By way of derogation, call options, the exercise of which may take place in the first five years, may be permitted only in the following two situations:
      - •	Tax and regulatory event call options, the exercise of which is subject to prior supervisory approval, and provided the IAIG was not in a position to anticipate such exercise at the time of issuance. Before granting approval, the supervisor ensures that after redemption of the instrument, the IAIG will cover its ICS capital requirement with a margin sufficient to ensure that the ICS will not be breached over the foreseeable future, taking into account any relevant trend and specificities of the IAIG.
      - •	Other call options, provided that their exercise complies with all of the following:
        - o	Prior to or concurrent with the exercise of the call, the IAIG replaces the called instrument with capital of the same or better quality, and the replacement of the called instrument is made on terms that are sustainable for the income capacity of the IAIG;
        - o	The IAIG demonstrates to the satisfaction of the supervisor that the call is economic; and
        - o	The call is approved by the supervisor.
        - When assessing whether the call is economic, the supervisor ensures that the cost of issuing the replacement instrument is lower than the cost of keeping the existing instrument outstanding. This analysis may consider various scenarios including, but not necessarily limited to, comparative spread levels and issuance volume.
    - f. The instrument may be repurchased by the issuer at any time with prior supervisory approval.
    - g. There is not an expectation created by the IAIG, through the terms of the instrument or otherwise, that the IAIG will repurchase the instrument or exercise any right to call the instrument, or that the repurchase or redemption will receive supervisory approval.
    - h. The IAIG has full discretion at all times to forego or cancel distributions (ie dividends and coupon payments are non-cumulative). The IAIG’s obligation to pay missed distributions is forever extinguished and non-payment is not an event of default.
    - i. Distributions are paid out of distributable items, including retained earnings.
    - j. The instrument does not have distributions that are linked to the credit standing or financial condition of the IAIG or a related entity, such that those distributions may accelerate winding- up.
    - k. The instrument is neither undermined nor rendered ineffective by encumbrances. In particular, the priority of claims is not compromised by guarantees or security arrangements given by either the IAIG or a related entity over which the IAIG exercises control or significant influence, for the benefit of investors.
    - l. Neither the IAIG nor a related entity over which the IAIG exercises control or significant influence has purchased the instrument, nor has the IAIG directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.
    - m. The paid-in amount is recognised as equity capital (ie is not recognised as a liability) where a determination that liabilities exceed assets constitutes a test of insolvency.
    - n. The instrument does not possess features that hinder recapitalisation, such as provisions that require the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is issued at a lower price during a specified time frame.
    - o. If the instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the holding company of the IAIG (eg it is issued out of an SPV), proceeds are made immediately available, without limitation, to an operating entity or the holding company of the IAIG, through the issuance of an instrument that meets or exceeds all of the other criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 limited capital resources (ie the SPV may only hold assets that are intercompany instruments issued by the IAIG or a related entity with terms and conditions that meet or exceed the criteria for Tier 1 limited capital resources).
- L2-113. Instruments issued before the date of adoption of the ICS may be considered compliant with T1 Limited criterion e., even when the relevant supervisor has not committed to check the economic nature of a call before granting approval of that call within the first 5 years. This legacy exemption is applicable until the instrument is redeemed.
</TabPanel>
<TabPanel header="Tier 2 (not subordinated)">
**4.2.3	Tier 2 financial instruments (other than structurally subordinated)**
- L2-114. Financial instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 (Unlimited or Limited) capital resources, but meet all of the following criteria qualify as Tier 2 capital resources:
    - a. The instrument is fully paid-up.
    - b. The instrument is subordinated to policyholders and other non-subordinated creditors of the IAIG.
    - c. The instrument has an initial maturity of at least five years with its effective maturity date defined to be the earlier of:
      - i. The first call date, together with a step-up or other incentive to redeem the instrument; and
      - ii. The contractual maturity date fixed in the instrument’s terms and conditions.
    - d. The instrument’s availability to absorb losses as it nears its effective maturity is captured by either:
      - i. Decreasing the qualifying amount of the instrument from 100% to 0% on a straight- line basis in the final five years prior to maturity; or
      - ii. The existence of a lock-in clause.
    - e. If the instrument is callable within the first five years from the date of issue:
      - •	Any such call is at the option of the issuer only;
      - •	Any such call is subject to supervisory approval; and
      - •	The called instrument must be replaced in full before or at redemption by a new issuance of the same or higher quality instrument.
      - The obligation of replacement mentioned in the third bullet point above may be waived when the call is tied to a materially adverse tax or regulatory event that could not reasonably be anticipated at the time of issuance; or
      - Before granting approval, the supervisor ensures that after redemption of the instrument, the IAIG will cover its ICS capital requirement with a margin sufficient to ensure that the ICS will not be breached over the foreseeable future, taking into account any relevant trend and specificities of the IAIG.
      - Other than in cases of replacement outlined above, the instrument is only callable atthe option of the issuer after a minimum of five years from the date of issue and prior supervisory approval is required for any redemption prior to contractual maturity.
    <Accordion activeIndex={[0]}>
    <AccordionTab header="(exception) prior supervisory approval is not required ">
      In the absence of a requirement for prior supervisory approval, this criterion is considered to be met if the following conditions are met:
        - • The terms of the financial instrument include a lock-in feature that prevents redemption when a firm does not comply with its regulatory capital requirement (or where redemption would lead to non-compliance);
        - • Either:
          - - the supervisor receives prior notification upon redemption, or
          - - call dates are fixed and known and the supervisor monitors potential redemption; and
        - • The supervisor has the power to prevent redemption of the instrument.
          
    </AccordionTab>
    </Accordion>
    
    - f. The instrument may be repurchased by the issuer at any time with prior supervisory approval.
    - g. There is not an expectation created by the IAIG, through the terms of the instrument or otherwise, that the IAIG will repurchase the instrument or exercise its right to call the instrument, or that the repurchase or redemption will receive supervisory approval.
    - h. The instrument does not have distributions that are linked to the credit standing or financial condition of the IAIG or a related entity, such that those distributions may accelerate winding- up.
    - i. The instrument does not give holders rights to accelerate the repayment of scheduled principal or coupon payments, except in winding-up.
    - j. The instrument is neither undermined nor rendered ineffective by encumbrances. In particular, the priority of claims is not compromised by guarantees or security arrangements given by either the IAIG or a related entity over which the IAIG exercises control or significant influence, for the benefit of investors.
    - k. Neither the IAIG nor a related entity over which the IAIG exercises control or significant influence has purchased the instrument, nor has the IAIG directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the instrument.
    - l. If the instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the holding company of the IAIG (eg it is issued out of an SPV), proceeds are made immediately available, without limitation, to an operating entity or the holding company of the IAIG, through the issuance of an instrument that meets or exceeds all of the other criteria for inclusion in paid-up Tier 2 capital resources (ie the SPV may only hold assets that are intercompany instruments issued by the IAIG or a related entity with terms and conditions that meet or exceed the criteria for Tier 2 Paid-Up capital resources).
- L2-115. Instruments issued before the date of adoption of the ICS, which can be called only at a make-whole price, may be considered compliant with Tier 2 Paid-Up criterion e., even in the absence of a commitment or requirement to replace the instrument before or concurrent to a call within the first five years of issuance. This legacy exemption is applicable until the instrument is redeemed.

<TabPanel header="subordinated Tier 2 ">
**4.2.4	Structurally subordinated Tier 2 financial instruments**
- L2-116. Structural subordination of debt refers to a situation where a holding company issues a financial instrument directly to third party investors and then down-streams the proceeds into insurance subsidiaries.
- L2-117. Structurally subordinated financial instruments that meet the criteria for Tier 2 financial instruments, subject to the clarifications of criteria b), e), and f), and new criteria n), o), and p) below, qualify as Tier 2 capital resources:
    - b.  Subordination to other non-subordinated creditors of the IAIG is not relevant to structurally subordinated instruments that are issued by an IAIG’s holding company to senior creditors.
    - e. The requirement for supervisory approval of such a call within the first five years from the date of issue can be fulfilled through the exercise of supervisory controls and supervisory review, including the ability (direct/indirect) for supervisors to limit, defer and/or disallow the issuance or redemption of financial instruments. The requirement for supervisory approval of redemptions after a minimum of five years can be fulfilled through supervisory approval12 of dividends prior to their payment from an insurance subsidiary to the holding company.
    - f. The requirement for supervisory approval of repurchases can be fulfilled through supervisory approval <GTooltipIcon desc="For structurally subordinated financial instruments, supervisory approval of ordinary dividends can be met if the supervisor has in place supervisory controls over distributions, including the ability for the supervisor to limit, defer and/or disallow the payment of any distributions should it find that the insurer is presently, or may potentially become, financially distressed."/> of dividends prior to their payment from an insurance subsidiary to the holding company.
    - n. The debt instrument has been issued by a clean holding company, which is defined as a holding company that does not have policyholder liabilities on its stand-alone balance sheet.
    - o. The IAIG and its GWS have determined that the proceeds of the instruments, which have been down-streamed into insurance subsidiaries, are being tracked and reported appropriately.
    - p. Amounts from the instrument issuance have been down-streamed into an insurance subsidiary of the holding company and the insurance subsidiary is located in a jurisdiction whose regulatory regime proactively enforces structural subordination through appropriate regulatory/supervisory controls over distributions from insurance subsidiaries.<GTooltipIcon desc="Supervisory controls over distributions from insurance subsidiaries refer to the supervisory review and/or prior supervisory approval of all distributions, including the ability for the supervisor to limit, defer and/or disallow the payment of any distributions should it find that the insurer is presently, or may potentially become, financially distressed. As part of its review and/or prior approval of distributions, the relevant supervisor considers surplus adequacy, financial flexibility, the quality of earnings, and other factors deemed to be pertinent as they relate to the financial strength of the insurer and policyholder protection."/>

<GCallout severity="success" title ="National discretion on acceleration clauses">
- L2-118. Criterion i. in paragraph L2-114 is subject to a national discretion. When a GWS elects to apply that national discretion, criterion i. is waived for all IAIGs headquartered in the jurisdiction of that GWS.
- L2-119. IAIGs to which the national discretion applies provide a reconciliation of the impact between the ICS with and without applying the national discretion.
</GCallout>

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel header="Tier 2 Non-paid-up capital ">
**4.2.5	Tier 2 Non-paid-up capital**
- L2-120. Non-paid-up capital consists of commitments, received by entities of the IAIG from third parties non-related to the IAIG, to provide capital upon request.
- L2-121. Financial items, contracts and arrangements established by mutual IAIGs qualify as Tier 2 Non-paid-up capital resources when they meet all of the following criteria:
    - a. The item has been approved by the supervisor as satisfying criteria b) to g) below as to its characteristics and amount.
    - b. The item can be called up on demand by the mutual IAIG and is not subject to any contingencies or conditions that prevent or act as a disincentive to the call being made or satisfied.
    - c. When called up, the item becomes either a financial instrument that meets in full the criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2 paid-up capital resources or a capital element listed in section 4.3.
    - d. The item is legally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction.
    - e. The counterparty to the contract to provide capital is able and willing to pay the agreed amounts when called upon by the mutual IAIG.
    - f. The item is neither undermined nor rendered ineffective by encumbrances.
    - g. The mutual IAIG is required to notify the supervisor of any changes of fact or circumstance that could affect the supervisor’s approval of the item.

## 4.3	Capital elements other than financial instruments
<TabView>
<TabPanel header="4.3.1.Tier 1 capital elements ">
- L1-58.  Subject to any exclusion, adjustment or deduction as specified in section 4.4.1, Tier 1 capital elements, other than financial instruments, include the following items:
    - a) Retained earnings;
    - b) Share premium, resulting from the issuance of instruments included in Tier 1, and other forms of contributed surplus earned from sources other than profits;
    - c) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI);
    - d) The fair market value of equity-settled employee stock options, provided that a corresponding expense is recorded in the profit and loss account of the IAIG, under applicable accounting standards; and
    - e) Other allocated to equity, which includes:
      - i. Minority/Non-controlling interests (NCI); and
      - ii. Adjustments applied to the IAIG’s consolidated balance sheet (as per audited financial statements) to produce the ICS balance sheet.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel header="4.3.2.Tier 2 capital elements ">
- L1-59.  Subject to any exclusion, adjustment or deduction as specified in section 4.4.2, Tier 2 capital elements, other than financial instruments, include the following:
    - a) Share premium resulting from the issuance of instruments included in Tier 2 Paid-Up capital resources;
    - b) The value of encumbered assets in excess of the on-balance sheet liabilities secured by the encumbered assets and incremental ICS capital requirement, in respect of those assets and liabilities excluded from Tier 1 (see section 4.4.3 for details on the treatment of encumbered assets); and
    - c) The Tier 2 basket, comprised of proportions of the following three items which relate to deductions from Tier 1 (see section 4.4.1):
      - i. the value of each net defined benefit pension fund that is an asset on the IAIG’s balance sheet, net of any eligible Deferred Tax Liability (DTL);
      - ii. Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) deducted from Tier 1 capital resources; and
      - iii. the value of computer software intangibles (net of amortisation) deducted from Tier 1 capital resources, net of any eligible DTL.
- L1-60. The Tier 2 basket is subject to a limit, expressed as a percentage of the ICS capital requirement.
- L1-61. The proportions of the three items included in the Tier 2 basket, as well as the overall limit applicable to the basket, are specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-122. The Tier 2 basket comprises the following three items, subject to a limit of 15% of the ICS capital requirement:
    - a. 50% of the value of each net defined benefit pension fund that is an asset on the IAIG’s balance sheet, net of any eligible DTL;
    - b. 100% of the DTA deducted from Tier 1 capital resources; and
    - c. 10% of the value of computer software intangibles (net of amortisation) deducted from Tier 1 capital resources, net of any eligible DTL.


</TabPanel>

## 4.4	Capital adjustments and deductions

<TabView>
<TabPanel header="Tier 1 ">
**4.4.1	Deductions from Tier 1 capital resources**
- L1-62. To the extent that they have not already been excluded through valuation in the ICS balance sheet, the following items are deducted from Tier 1 capital resources:
    - a) Goodwill;
    - b) Intangible assets, including computer software intangibles;
    - c) Each asset recognised on the IAIG’s balance sheet that relates to a defined benefit pension fund;
    - d) DTAs on the ICS balance sheet;
    - e) Reciprocal cross holdings, arranged either directly or indirectly between financial institutions and that artificially inflate the Tier 1 capital position of the IAIG;
    - f) Direct and indirect investments in own Tier 1 capital instruments, not otherwise eliminated;
    - g) Reinsurance assets arising from arrangements deemed to constitute non-qualifying reinsurance; and
    - h) Encumbered assets in excess of the on-balance sheet liabilities secured by the encumbered assets and incremental ICS capital requirement in respect of those assets and liabilities (see section 4.4.3 for details on the treatment of encumbered assets).
- L1-63. Items a) to c) are net of any associated DTL that would be extinguished if the item becomes impaired or derecognised under the valuation approach.
</TabPanel>
<TabPanel header="Tier 2 ">
**4.4.2	Deductions from Tier 2 capital resources**
- L1-64. To the extent that they have not already been excluded through valuation in the ICS balance sheet, the following items are deducted from Tier 2 capital resources:
    - a) Reciprocal cross holdings, arranged either directly or indirectly between financial institutions and that artificially inflate the Tier 2 capital position of the IAIG; and
    - b) Direct and indirect investments in own Tier 2 capital instruments, not otherwise eliminated.
</TabPanel>
</TabView>

### 4.4.3	Treatment of encumbered assets
- L1-65. When an IAIG holds encumbered assets in excess of the liabilities and associated risks for which those assets have been encumbered, an adjustment to Tier 1 capital resources is made.
- L1-66. The details of this adjustment are specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-123. The deduction from Tier 1 capital resources is calculated as the total value of encumbered assets in excess of the sum of the value of the IAIG’s on-balance sheet liabilities secured by the encumbered assets, plus the value of the IAIG’s incremental ICS capital requirement for encumbered assets and secured liabilities.
- L2-124. No Tier 1 deduction is required for encumbered assets relating to off-balance sheet securities financing transactions (ie securities lending and borrowing, repos and reverse repos) that do not result in a liability on the balance sheet.
- L1-67. The amount of encumbered assets deducted from Tier 1 capital resources is included in Tier 2 capital resources, subject to the limits applicable to Tier 2 (see section 4.5 on capital composition limits).

### 4.4.4	Limit on non-controlling interests
- L1-68. Non-controlling interests (NCI) are subject to a limit calculated at a legal entity level. L1-69. The calculation of the NCI limit is specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-125. For each legal entity generating NCI at group level, a NCI limit is calculated as:
  <GMath title = "NIC Limit">
    $\text{NCI proportion}$ x $\text{Estimated contribution to group ICS}$
  </GMath>
  <GCmt>
        - • $\text{NCI proportion}$ =$\frac{\text{Equity elements issued to 3rd  parties}}{Total equity}$
        - • $\text{Estimated contribution to group ICS}$ = $\alpha * \text{liabilities}$
        - • $\alpha = \frac{\text{group ICS capital requirement}}{\text{group GAAP liabilities}}$
  </GCmt>
- L2-126. The amount of NCI generated by that entity and exceeding the limit calculated above is deducted from the amount of Tier 1 capital resources.

 
## 4.5	Capital composition limits
- L1-70. The Tier 1 Limited and Tier 2 capital resources after adjustments, exclusions and deductions are subject to limits expressed as a percentage of the ICS capital requirement. Those limits, which may differ depending on the IAIG being mutual or non-mutual, are specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-127. For a non-mutual IAIG, the following limits are applicable:
    - a. Tier 1 Limited capital resources are limited to 10% of the ICS capital requirement; this limit is increased to 15%, provided that the instruments in excess of the 10% limit possess a Principle Loss Absorbency Mechanism (PLAM);
    - b. Tier 2 capital resources are limited to 50% of the ICS capital requirement; and
    - c. There is no allowance for Tier 2 Non-Paid Up capital.
- L2-128. For the purpose of paragraph L2-127, a PLAM is defined as a mechanism providing for either a write-down of the liability (principal and dividend/coupon) or a conversion of the instrument (into a Tier 1 unlimited financial instrument as defined in section 4.2.1) in contractually predefined going-concern conditions.
- L2-129. For a mutual IAIG, the following limits are applicable:
    - a. Tier 1 Limited capital resources are limited to 30% of the ICS capital requirement;
    - b. Tier 1 Limited + Tier 2 capital resources are limited to 60% of the ICS capital requirement; and
    - c. Tier 2 Non-Paid Up capital are limited to 10% of the ICS capital requirement.
- L1-71. The GWS, in consultation with the supervisory college, may apply temporary supervisory forbearance on the limit on Tier 1 Limited capital resources for mutual IAIGs, provided that the IAIG submits a plan to restore its capital position.
- L1-72. Tier 1 Limited capital resources that are in excess of the associated limit are eligible for inclusion within Tier 2 capital resources, and become subject to the limit applicable to Tier 2 capital resources.
