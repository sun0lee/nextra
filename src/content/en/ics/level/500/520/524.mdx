## 5.2. Insurance Risks
### 5.2.4  Calculation of Catastrophe risk charges
- L1-104. Catastrophe risk is a risk that affects both life and non-life business. The Catastrophe risk charge covers risks associated with low frequency, high severity events occurring at any point in time in the next 12 months and takes into account all expected in-force business when the event occurs.
- L1-105. Risk mitigation arrangements (eg outwards reinsurance protection purchased) may reduce the overall Catastrophe risk charge.
- L1-106. Catastrophe risk is segmented at the risk/peril level. Perils cover both naturally occurring perils (natural catastrophes) and man-made perils/scenarios (other catastrophes) and their consequences.
- L1-107. The impact of catastrophe claim events include not only the main peril (eg windstorm, earthquake) but also the secondary perils associated with the primary peril. Secondary perils can affect all lines of business within the scope of the calculation.
- L1-108. The perils, scenarios and allowable risk mitigation, along with prudential safeguards for the use of models to calculate the natural catastrophe risk charge, are specified in the Level 2 text.

#### 5.2.4.1  Scope of calculation
- L2-181. When calculating the Catastrophe risk charge, all lines of business exposed to Catastrophe risk are considered. To avoid double counting with the other ICS risk charges, the following principles are applied:
  - a.  Life and similar to life health business are included only for the pandemic and the terrorism scenarios; and
  - b.  The impact on financial markets and the whole economy (Market and Credit risks) is not included in the calculation of Catastrophe risk.

#### 5.2.4.2  Covered perils
- L2-182. The perils covered by Catastrophe risk are:
  - a.  Natural catastrophe:
    - i.  Tropical cyclone, hurricane, typhoon; 
    - ii.  Extra-tropical windstorm/winter storm;
    - iii.  Earthquake; and
    - iv.  Other material natural perils, such as:
      - • Flood;
       •  Tornado, hail, convective storms;
       •  Other risks.
  - b.  Other catastrophes (Man-Made Perils/Scenarios):
    - i.  Terrorist attack;
    - ii.  Pandemic; and
    - iii.  Credit and Surety.
- L2-183. The impact of catastrophe claim events include both the main peril and any secondary perils associated with the main peril.

#### 5.2.4.3  Natural catastrophe
- L2-184. Stochastic catastrophe models may be used to calculate loss amounts resulting from natural catastrophe events.
- L2-185. Loss amounts are calculated considering:
  - a.  The impact of natural catastrophe on all lines of business affected;
  - b.  An allowance for non-modelled exposures including expected new business over the target time horizon of one year that could be affected by the listed perils; and
  - c.  An allowance for non-modelled perils and regions reported as part of the other natural catastrophe losses. This may include perils and regions that are not modelled individually or specifically but for which potential losses are assessed using other approaches.
- L2-186. The natural catastrophe risk charge is the difference between the 99.5th percentile and the mean of the total annual aggregate losses, net of protections. The annual aggregate losses are calculated as the aggregation of losses across all regions and perils.

#### 5.2.4.4  Other catastrophe scenarios
- L2-187. The loss amounts for the following perils are determined according to the scenarios described below.
- L2-188. The impact of the scenarios is calculated for all lines of business affected by the respective scenario, unless otherwise specified in the scope of the calculation.

<TabPanel header="1)  Terrorist attack ">
  - L2-189. The risk charge is the sum of the losses from the following two components:
    - a.  Total loss of property (including building, content, motor vehicles) from insurance contracts and the impact on other insurance contracts resulting directly from the loss of property; and
    - b.  The losses from life insurance contracts, health coverage and workers’ compensation.
  - L2-190. For both the life and non-life components, the scenario is a five-tonne bomb blast for the largest geographical risk concentration partly or fully located within a radius of 500 metres. To determine this concentration, all buildings (including properties for own use) are considered. The largest concentration is determined separately for the life and non-life components.
  - L2-191. For property damage, including insured properties and related covers, the following assumptions are made:
    - • 100% damage ratio within a circular zone of a 200 metre radius;
    - • 25% damage ratio for the next circular zone up to a 400 metre radius; and
    - • 10% damage ratio between 400 and 500 metres. L2-192. For fatalities, the following assumptions are made:
    - • 15% fatality rate within a circular zone of a 200 metre radius; and
    - • 1.5% fatality rate between 200 and 500 metres.
  - L2-193. For disabilities, the following assumptions are made:
    - • 20% disability rate within a circular zone of a 200 metre radius; and
    - • 10% fatality rate between 200 and 500 metres.

<TabPanel header="2)  Pandemic ">
  - L2-194. The scenario is an increase in the number of deaths following a global pandemic. The risk charge is the total loss amount to all individual and group insurance products covering Mortality risk in any part of the world resulting from the increase of 1.0 in the number of deaths per thousand insureds.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel header="3)  Credit and Surety ">
  - L2-195. The risk charge is the sum of the losses from the following three components:
  <Accordion activeIndex={[0]}>
  <AccordionTab header=" a. Mortgage insurance">
    - L2-196. The scenario is calculated as an aggregate loss amount resulting from an increase in frequency and severity due to the specified decline in home prices. A 25% decline in home prices is assumed to persist for the entire one-year time period. The total loss amount includes the impact of both an increase in frequency of delinquency and defaults and an increased loss severity that result from the decline in home prices.
      
  </AccordionTab>
  <AccordionTab header="b. Trade credit ">
    - L2-197. The credit stress scenario for trade credit is defined as the total loss amount due to the inability of customers of the policyholder to pay for goods delivered and/or services provided. The trade credit coverage indemnifies the policyholder for bad debt losses incurred due to a customer’s inability to pay. A policyholder’s customer’s inability to pay is indicated by an increase in both the probability of default and the loss given default of that customer. The total loss amount is adjusted for any existing loss mitigation, including reimbursements from policyholder, retention etc.

  <AccordionTab header="c. Surety ">
    - L2-198. The credit stress scenario for surety is defined as the total net potential loss amount based on the penal sum of the surety bond. A surety bond indemnifies the policyholder from the principal’s inability to perform its contractual obligation. The penal sum represents the maximum amount that the IAIG is required to pay to the beneficiary. The IAIG calculates the largest net potential losses for its ten largest exposures to surety counterparties (principals) using the methodology described below. The total net potential loss amount assumes that the two largest net losses have occurred, and is therefore equal to the sum of the two largest net losses.

#### 5.2.4.5  Aggregation of catastrophe risks
- L2-199. For the purpose of calculating the Catastrophe risk charge, the other catastrophe scenarios are assumed to be mutually independent and independent of the natural catastrophe perils. Consequently, the total ICS catastrophe capital charge will be calculated as follows:
<GMath title = "ICS_Cat">
$$
\sqrt{ICS_{NatCat}^2 + ICS_{Terror}^2 + ICS_{Pand}^2 + ICS_{credit}^2}
$$
</GMath>


#### 5.2.4.6  Calculation of the recoverable amount to be used for the calculation of contingent Credit risk
- L2-200. The recoverable amount is calculated as the difference between the risk charge for Catastrophe risk calculated as if the risk mitigation arrangements did not exist, and the risk charge for Catastrophe risk calculated taking into account qualifying risk mitigation arrangements.
- L2-201. The recoverable amount is allocated by credit rating categories, using the following steps:
  - a.  For the aggregate of the Natural Catastrophe risk and for each Other catastrophe scenario, calculate the recoveries by rating class and the gross and net losses;
  - b.  Aggregate all gross and net losses using the aggregation approach described above. The difference between aggregated gross and net losses is the total recoverable; and
  - c.  The recoverable by rating class is equal to the total recoverable multiplied by the ratio of the sum over all scenarios of the recoveries in that rating class to the sum over all scenarios of the recoveries for all rating classes.
 

#### 5.2.4.7  Safeguards for natural catastrophe models
