## 5.3  Market risks
### 5.3.1  Calculation of the Market risk charge
- L1-109. The market risk charge is calculated by aggregating, using the market risks correlation matrix specified in the Level 2 text, the following six sub-risk charges:
    - • Interest Rate risk;
    - • Non-Default Spread risk;
    - • Equity risk;
    - • Real Estate risk;
    - • Currency risk; and
    - • Asset Concentration risk.
- L1-110. When calculating the market risk charges, the following impacts are considered:
    - • The direct impacts of the prescribed stress scenarios on the value of assets and liabilities; and
    - • The indirect impacts linked to potential changes in policyholder behaviour following the prescribed stress scenarios.
- L1-111. For each of the six sub-risks, the risk charge is calculated both with and without the impact of management actions.
- L2-203. The correlation matrix used for aggregating the market risk charges is the following:

|                      | Interest Rate | NDSR Up | NDSR Down | Equity | Real Estate | Currency | Asset Concentration |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Interest Rate**     | 100%          | 25%     | 25%       | 25%    | 25%          | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **NDSR Up**           | 25%           | 100%    | 100%      | 75%    | 50%          | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **NDSR Down**         | 25%           | 100%    | 100%      | 0%     | 0%           | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **Equity**            | 25%           | 75%     | 0%        | 100%   | 50%          | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **Real Estate**       | 25%           | 50%     | 0%        | 50%    | 100%         | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **Currency**          | 25%           | 25%     | 25%       | 25%    | 25%          | 100%     | 0%                   |
| **Asset Concentration** | 0%          | 0%      | 0%        | 0%     | 0%           | 0%       | 100%                 |
