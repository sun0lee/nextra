### 5.3.2  Interest Rate risk
- L1-112. The calculation of the Interest Rate risk charge is based on a combination of three stresses applied to the entire risk-free yield curve for each relevant currency as identified in paragraph L1- 114:
    - ‚Ä¢ A mean-reversion scenario;
    - ‚Ä¢ A level up scenario; and
    - ‚Ä¢ A level down scenario.
- L1-113. The characteristics of those stresses are specified in the Level 2 text. The stress scenarios are applied only to assets and liabilities that are sensitive to a change in the level of risk-free rates; the identification of assets and liabilities subject to the stresses is specified in the Level 2 text. The impact of those stresses on lapse rates, due to the influence of market conditions on policyholder behaviour, is taken into account as specified in the Level 2 text.
- L1-114. The impact of the scenarios listed above is calculated for all currencies in which the IAIG holds interest rate sensitive assets or liabilities. Currencies for which the exposure is non-material may be grouped together. The stress impacts calculated for each currency or group thereof are then combined to derive the overall Interest Rate risk charge.
- L1-115. The methodology to aggregate the results across the five stresses and relevant currencies, is specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-204. All assets and liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates are taken into account in the calculation of the Interest Rate risk charge, with the exception of financial instruments issued by the IAIG that qualify as capital resources.
- L2-205. For current estimates of insurance liabilities calculated with a dynamic lapse function that uses the interest rate as an input variable, the base lapse assumptions stay unchanged under the interest rate stresses, but lapse rates react to the interest rate scenarios used to calculate the Interest Rate risk charge.
- L2-206. The Interest Rate risk charge is calculated as:
<GMath title="Interest Rate risk charge">
$$
max\left( 0. \sum_i MR_i + VaR_{99.5} \Big(\sum_i LT_i\Big)\right)
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $i$ is an index over all currencies in which the IAIG is exposed to Interest Rate risk;
- ‚Ä¢ $MR_i$ is the result of the mean reversion scenario for currency $i$, obtained as described in paragraph L2-209; and
- ‚Ä¢ $LT_i$ is a random variable encompassing the result
</GCmt>

- L2-207. For currency $i$, $LT_i$ is defined as:
<GMath title ="LT">
$$
\frac{1}{N^{-1}(0.995)}\times (LU_i max(X_i,0)-LD_i min(X_i,0))
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $N^{-1}(0.995)$ is the 99.5% quantile of the standardised normal distribution;
- ‚Ä¢ $LU_i$, and $LD_i$ are the results of the level up and level down scenarios respectively, obtained as described in paragraph L2-209; and
- ‚Ä¢ $X_i$ is a random variable following a standardised normal distribution.
</GCmt>
- L2-208. In addition, the random variables $X_i$ are such that for any $i \ne j$, $corr(X_i,X_j)=0.75$.
- L2-209. For currency $i$, $MR_i$, $LU_i$ and $LD_i$ correspond to the change in the IAIG‚Äôs Net Asset Value when recalculating the value of all relevant assets and liabilities using the mean reversion, level up and level down stressed yield curves respectively, obtained using the methodology described in paragraphs L2-210 to L2-215.
- L2-210. For each currency, the stressed yield curve for the mean reversion scenario is obtained by adding the following yield curve to the initial yield curve, up to the LOT:
<GMath title ="the stressed yield curve for the mean reversion scenario">
$$
