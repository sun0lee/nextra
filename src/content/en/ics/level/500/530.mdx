## 5.3	Market risks
### 5.3.1	Calculation of the Market risk charge
- L1-109. The market risk charge is calculated by aggregating, using the market risks correlation matrix specified in the Level 2 text, the following six sub-risk charges:
    - ‚Ä¢	Interest Rate risk;
    - ‚Ä¢	Non-Default Spread risk;
    - ‚Ä¢	Equity risk;
    - ‚Ä¢	Real Estate risk;
    - ‚Ä¢	Currency risk; and
    - ‚Ä¢	Asset Concentration risk.
- L1-110. When calculating the market risk charges, the following impacts are considered:
    - ‚Ä¢	The direct impacts of the prescribed stress scenarios on the value of assets and liabilities; and
    - ‚Ä¢	The indirect impacts linked to potential changes in policyholder behaviour following the prescribed stress scenarios.
- L1-111. For each of the six sub-risks, the risk charge is calculated both with and without the impact of management actions.
- L2-203. The correlation matrix used for aggregating the market risk charges is the following:

|                      | Interest Rate | NDSR Up | NDSR Down | Equity | Real Estate | Currency | Asset Concentration |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Interest Rate**     | 100%          | 25%     | 25%       | 25%    | 25%          | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **NDSR Up**           | 25%           | 100%    | 100%      | 75%    | 50%          | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **NDSR Down**         | 25%           | 100%    | 100%      | 0%     | 0%           | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **Equity**            | 25%           | 75%     | 0%        | 100%   | 50%          | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **Real Estate**       | 25%           | 50%     | 0%        | 50%    | 100%         | 25%      | 0%                   |
| **Currency**          | 25%           | 25%     | 25%       | 25%    | 25%          | 100%     | 0%                   |
| **Asset Concentration** | 0%          | 0%      | 0%        | 0%     | 0%           | 0%       | 100%                 |

### 5.3.2	Interest Rate risk
- L1-112. The calculation of the Interest Rate risk charge is based on a combination of three stresses applied to the entire risk-free yield curve for each relevant currency as identified in paragraph L1- 114:
    - ‚Ä¢	A mean-reversion scenario;
    - ‚Ä¢	A level up scenario; and
    - ‚Ä¢	A level down scenario.
- L1-113. The characteristics of those stresses are specified in the Level 2 text. The stress scenarios are applied only to assets and liabilities that are sensitive to a change in the level of risk-free rates; the identification of assets and liabilities subject to the stresses is specified in the Level 2 text. The impact of those stresses on lapse rates, due to the influence of market conditions on policyholder behaviour, is taken into account as specified in the Level 2 text.
- L1-114. The impact of the scenarios listed above is calculated for all currencies in which the IAIG holds interest rate sensitive assets or liabilities. Currencies for which the exposure is non-material may be grouped together. The stress impacts calculated for each currency or group thereof are then combined to derive the overall Interest Rate risk charge.
- L1-115. The methodology to aggregate the results across the five stresses and relevant currencies, is specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-204. All assets and liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates are taken into account in the calculation of the Interest Rate risk charge, with the exception of financial instruments issued by the IAIG that qualify as capital resources.
- L2-205. For current estimates of insurance liabilities calculated with a dynamic lapse function that uses the interest rate as an input variable, the base lapse assumptions stay unchanged under the interest rate stresses, but lapse rates react to the interest rate scenarios used to calculate the Interest Rate risk charge.
- L2-206. The Interest Rate risk charge is calculated as:
<GMath title="Interest Rate risk charge">
$$
max\left( 0. \sum_i MR_i + VaR_{99.5} \Big(\sum_i LT_i\Big)\right)
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $i$ is an index over all currencies in which the IAIG is exposed to Interest Rate risk;
- ‚Ä¢ $MR_i$ is the result of the mean reversion scenario for currency $i$, obtained as described in paragraph L2-209; and
- ‚Ä¢ $LT_i$ is a random variable encompassing the result
</GCmt>

- L2-207. For currency $i$, $LT_i$ is defined as:
<GMath title ="LT">
$$
\frac{1}{N^{-1}(0.995)}\times (LU_i max(X_i,0)-LD_i min(X_i,0))
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $N^{-1}(0.995)$ is the 99.5% quantile of the standardised normal distribution;
- ‚Ä¢ $LU_i$, and $LD_i$ are the results of the level up and level down scenarios respectively, obtained as described in paragraph L2-209; and
- ‚Ä¢ $X_i$ is a random variable following a standardised normal distribution.
</GCmt>
- L2-208. In addition, the random variables $X_i$ are such that for any $i \ne j$, $corr(X_i,X_j)=0.75$.
- L2-209. For currency $i$, $MR_i$, $LU_i$ and $LD_i$ correspond to the change in the IAIG‚Äôs Net Asset Value when recalculating the value of all relevant assets and liabilities using the mean reversion, level up and level down stressed yield curves respectively, obtained using the methodology described in paragraphs L2-210 to L2-215.
- L2-210. For each currency, the stressed yield curve for the mean reversion scenario is obtained by adding the following yield curve to the initial yield curve, up to the LOT:
<GMath title ="the stressed yield curve for the mean reversion scenario">
$$
\Delta L \cdot \text{Level curve} + \Delta S \cdot \text{Slope curve} + \Delta C \cdot \text{Curvature curve}  
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $\text{Level curve}$ is the curve equal to 1 for all maturities;
- ‚Ä¢ $\text{Slope curve}$ is the curve equal to $\frac{1-e^{\lambda \tau}}{\lambda \tau}$ for any maturity $\tau$;
- ‚Ä¢ $\text{Curvature curve}$ is the curve equal to $\frac{1-e^{\lambda \tau}}{\lambda \tau} -e^{\lambda \tau}$ for any maturity $\tau$;
- ‚Ä¢ ùúÜ is the exponential decay rate of the Nelson Siegel model<GTooltipIcon desc="As described in the article Diebold, F.X. and Li, C (2006) Forecasting the Term Structure of Government Bond Yields in Journal of Econometrics, 130, 337-364"/> for the risk-free yield curve;
- ‚Ä¢ $\begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta L_{} \\
        \Delta S_{} \\
        \Delta C_{}
    \end{bmatrix}$ is the vector defined as $(I-e^{K})(\mu -V_0)$
- ‚Ä¢ $I$  is the 3ùë•3 identity matrix;
- ‚Ä¢ $ \begin{bmatrix}
        K_1 \; & 0 \;& 0 \\
        0 & K_2  \; & 0 \\
        0 & 0 \; & K_3
      \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}
        \Mu_1 \\
        \Mu_2 \\
        \Mu_3
    \end{bmatrix}$ are parameters of the process followed by the vector $V_t$ below, described by the equation: $d V_t = K(\Mu - V_t)dt+\Sigma d W_t$
- ‚Ä¢ $V_t = \begin{bmatrix}
        \beta_{1t} \\
        \beta_{2t} \\
        \beta_{3t}
    \end{bmatrix}$ where $\beta_{1t}$,$\beta_{2t}$ and $\beta_{3t}$ correspond to the Nelson Siegel parameters<GTooltipIcon desc="As described in the article Diebold, F.X. and Li, C (2006) Forecasting the Term Structure of Government Bond Yields in Journal of Econometrics, 130, 337-364"/> for the risk-free yield curve at time $t$; and 
- ‚Ä¢ $W_t$ is a 3-dimensional Wiener process and Œ£ is a lower triangular matrix of real non-negative factors.
</GCmt>

- L2-211. For the mean reversion scenario, the value of the LTFR remains unchanged.
- L2-212. For each currency, the stressed yield curve for the level up scenario is obtained by adding the following yield curve to the initial yield curve, up to the LOT:
<GMath title ="the stressed yield curve for the level up scenario">
$$
s \cdot N^{-1}(0.995)\cdot[ s \cdot l_1 \cdot \text{Level curve} + s \cdot l_2 \cdot \text{Slope curve} + s \cdot l_3 \cdot \text{Curvature curve}]  
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $\begin{bmatrix}
        sl_{1} \\
        sl_{2} \\
        sl_{3}
    \end{bmatrix} = Me_1$ 
- ‚Ä¢ $M = \sqrt{(\Sigma\Sigma^T) \odot \big( \frac{1-e^{-(K_i+K_j)}}{K_i+K_j}\big)_{ij}}$ with $\Sigma$ and $K_i$ denoting the parameters of the equation described in paragraph L2-210, and $\odot$ the Hadamard product operator;
- ‚Ä¢ $e_1$ is the eigenvector associated with the highest eigenvalue of the matrix $N^TN$;
- ‚Ä¢ $N =\begin{bmatrix}
      LOT \; & 0 \;& 0 \\
      0 & a  \; & 0 \\
      0 & 0 \; & b
  \end{bmatrix} M$
- ‚Ä¢ $a$ = $\sum_{tau = 1}^{LOT} \frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda \tau}$
- ‚Ä¢ $b$ = $\sum_{tau = 1}^{LOT} \frac{1-e^{-\lambda\tau}}{\lambda \tau} - e^{-\lambda \tau}$
- ‚Ä¢ $s = \begin{cases}
   1 &\text{if } (s l_1 \cdot \text{Level curve}_{LOT} + s l_2 \cdot \text{Slope curve}_{LOT} + s l_3 \cdot \text{Curvature curve}_{LOT}) \ge 0 \\
   -1 &\text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}$
</GCmt>
- L2-213. For the level up scenario, the LTFR is subject to an absolute increase equal to the minimum between:
    - ‚Ä¢	10% of the LTFR calculated in accordance with paragraphs L2-61 to L2-64; and
    - ‚Ä¢	the maximum annual change to the LTFR specified in paragraph L2-64.
- L2-214. For each currency, the stressed yield curve for the level down scenario is obtained by adding the following yield curve to the initial yield curve, up to the LOT:
<GMath title ="the stressed yield curve for the level down scenario">
$$
-s \cdot N^{-1}(0.995)\cdot[ s \cdot l_1 \cdot \text{Level curve} + s \cdot l_2 \cdot \text{Slope curve} + s \cdot l_3 \cdot \text{Curvature curve}]  
$$
</GMath>
- L2-215. For the level down scenario, the LTFR is subject to an absolute decrease equal to the minimum between:
    - ‚Ä¢	10% of the LTFR calculated in accordance with paragraphs L2-61 to L2-64; and
    - ‚Ä¢	the maximum annual change to the LTFR specified in paragraph L2-64.

### 5.3.3	Non-Default Spread risk
- L1-116. Non-Default Spread risk (NDSR) is calculated as a relative bi-directional stress applied to both assets and liabilities. The Non-Default Spread risk charge is calculated as the maximum of an upward and downward stress, subject to a floor of zero.
- L1-117. The characteristics of the stresses to apply, as well as the rules governing the identification of those assets and liabilities to which the stress applies, are specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-216. All liabilities sensitive to changes in spreads are taken into account in the calculation of the NDSR charge, with the exception of financial instruments issued by the IAIG that qualify as capital resources.
- L2-217. All assets that contribute to the calculation of the spread adjustments for valuation purposes (Table 2 in section 3.2.5.3.2.1), are taken into account in the calculation of the NDSR charge, with the exception of sovereign bonds.
- L2-218. For assets, the downward and upward spread stresses used for the calculation of the NDSR charge are a relative stress of -75% and +75% of the absolute value of spreads, respectively. The upward stress is subject to a cap and a floor.
  <GMath title ="Spread down(t)">
  $$
  spread(t) -75\% \times |spread(t)|
  $$
  </GMath>
  <GMath title ="Spread up(t)">
  $$
  spread(t)+ max\{40bps, min (150bps, 75\%\times |spread(t)|)\}
  $$
  </GMath>
  where $spread(t)$ is the current spread of the asset over the relevant risk-free rate and is measured in basis points (bps).

- L2-219. For the determination of the stressed insurance liabilities, the same stresses are applied to the input values (for ùë°>0) used to derive the spread adjustments to the relevant base yield curve. Then the same methodology as laid out in section 3.2.5.3.2 is applied to these stressed input values to determine the final spread adjustment after stress.

### 5.3.4	Equity risk
- L1-118. The Equity risk charge is calculated as the change in net asset value following the occurrence of stress scenarios that impact the level and volatility of the fair value of equities, after management actions. The level scenarios are specified by segments of assets. A volatility scenario is measured separately. The stress scenario is defined in the Level 2 text.
- L1-119. The Equity risk charge applies to direct and indirect exposures to all assets and liabilities with values sensitive to changes in the level or volatility of the fair value of equities as specified in the Level 2 text.
- L1-120. The Equity risk charge uses the following segmentation of assets as defined in the Level 2 text:
    - ‚Ä¢	Equity in developed markets, split between:
      - o	Listed equity (other than infrastructure); and
      - o	Infrastructure equity;
    - ‚Ä¢	Equity in emerging markets, split between:
      - o	Listed equity (other than infrastructure); and
      - o	Infrastructure equity;
    - ‚Ä¢	Hybrid debt/preference shares; and
    - ‚Ä¢	Other equity.
- L2-220. The following definitions apply to the equity segments listed in the Level 1 text.
- L2-221. Listed equity in developed markets includes equities listed on the securities exchanges of equity markets included in the FTSE Developed Index: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and US.
- L2-222. Any equity market not included in the FTSE Developed Index is considered an emerging market.
- L2-223. Infrastructure equity is comprised of equity assets that meet the definitions and criteria specified in sections 1 and 2 of Annex 3.
- L2-224. Investments in subordinated debt are included in the Equity risk charge within the segment hybrid debt/preference shares.
- L2-225. The segment other equity is comprised of all investments not included in the previous equity segments.
- L2-226. The four level scenarios (one for each asset segment) and volatility scenario are defined as:
    - a. A decrease by 35%, before applying the Neutral Adjusted Dampener (NAD), of the market prices of listed shares in developed markets, other than infrastructure equity, and by 27% of the market prices of infrastructure equity in developed markets. The impact of the decrease in value of listed equity and infrastructure equity is aggregated using a linear correlation factor of 1.
    - b. A decrease by 48%, before applying NAD, of the market prices of listed shares in emerging markets, other than infrastructure equity, and by 37% of the market prices of infrastructure equity in emerging markets. The impact of the decrease in value of listed equity and infrastructure equity is aggregated using a linear correlation factor of 0.75.
    - c. A decrease of the market prices of hybrid debt/preference shares by x%, with x based on the ICS rating category (RC) of the asset, as specified in Table 17.
      |ICS RC| 1-2|3|4|5|6-7|
      |:--:|--|--|--|--|--|
      | x%|4%|6%|11%|21%|35%|

      <GCaption>Table 17: Stress factors for hybrid debt/preference shares</GCaption>
    - d. A decrease by 49%, before applying NAD, of the market prices of all assets classified as other equity, as defined in paragraph L2-225.
    - e. A absolute increase by x% of the implied volatilities of all the asset classes listed above, with x having the values provided in Table 18. For maturities not specified, the increase is interpolated linearly.
      |Maturity(months)|0-1|3|6|12|24|36|48|60|
      |:--:|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
      |x%|42%|28%|23%|20%|17%|16%|15%|14%|

      |Maturity(months)|84|120|144|180|240|300|360 above|
      |:--:|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
      |x%|14%|12%|11%|10%|7%|4%|0%|

      <GCaption>Table 18: Absolute stress factors for implied volatilities</GCaption>

- L2-227. The NAD is an additive component that behaves in a counter-cyclical manner. The NAD ranges from -10% to +10% and is applied on the developed markets, emerging markets, and other equity asset segments. NAD is computed using the following formula:
<GMath title ="NAD">
$$
NAD = \left[a \times \left(\frac{CI_i - AI_i}{AI_i} - b \right) \right]_{-c}^{+c}
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
    - ‚Ä¢	$CI_i$ = Current Index value for category $i$
    - ‚Ä¢	$AI_i$ = 3 years moving average index for category $i$
    - ‚Ä¢	$a$ = 50%
    - ‚Ä¢	$b$ = 7%
    - ‚Ä¢	$c$ = 10%
</GCmt>
- L2-228. The results of the stresses listed above are aggregated in two steps:
    - a. Step 1: The total level risk is calculated by aggregating the impact of the stress for each level scenario, floored at zero, using the following correlation matrix:
      |Equity segment|Developed|Emerging|Hybrid/preferred| Other|
      |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
      |**Developed**|100%|75%|100%|75%|
      |**Emerging**|75%|100%|75%|75%|
      |**Hybrid/preferred**|100%|75%|100%|75%|
      |**Other**|75%|75%|75%|100%|

      <GCaption>Table 19: Equity correlation matrix</GCaption>
    - b. Step 2: The total Equity risk charge is calculated by summing the total level risk (from Step 1) and the impact of the stress under the volatility scenario.


### 5.3.5	Real Estate risk
- L1-121. The Real Estate risk charge is calculated as the change in the net asset value, following the occurrence of a prescribed stress scenario, based on a change in the level of real estate prices, after management actions, as specified in the Level 2 text.
- L1-122. The Real Estate risk stress scenario is applied to both direct and indirect exposures to real estate prices, without distinguishing between commercial, residential and real estate for own use (see section 1.3 on look-through), as specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-229. The stress scenario referred to in the Level 1 text is a decrease of 25% in real estate prices. Assets and liabilities subject to the stress are:
    - a.	Commercial investment real estate;
    - b.	Residential investment real estate;
    - c.	Real estate for own use;
    - d.	Other assets whose value is impacted by a change in real estate prices; and
    - e.	Liabilities, both insurance and other, whose value is impacted by a change in real estate prices.

### 5.3.6	Currency risk
- L1-123. The Currency risk charge is equal to the higher of the aggregated losses incurred under two stress scenarios on the exchange rates between the IAIG‚Äôs reporting currency and those currencies in which the IAIG holds assets or liabilities. The prescribed stresses are applied to the net open position determined for each relevant currency.
- L1-124. The net open position in a currency takes into account all direct and indirect exposures to that currency. Where relevant, an amount corresponding to jurisdictional capital requirements in that currency, subject to a cap, may be deducted from the net open position.
- L1-125. The two stress scenarios are:
    - a)	Scenario 1: All of the currencies in which the IAIG has a net long position decrease in value against the reporting currency, while all of the currencies in which the IAIG has a net short position remain unchanged; or
    - b)	Scenario 2: All of the currencies in which the IAIG has a net short position increase in value against the reporting currency, while all of the currencies in which the IAIG has a net long position remain unchanged.
- L1-126. Within each scenario, the losses by currency are aggregated using a correlation formula, as described in the Level 2 text.
- L1-127. The prescribed stresses for each currency pair, the aggregation formula, as well as the rules applicable to the determination of net open positions, are specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-230. In order to determine the Currency risk charge, the IAIG determines its net open position for all currencies other than the reporting currency. The net open position for each currency is calculated as the sum of the following:
    - a.	The net spot position, defined as all assets less liabilities, including accrued interest and accrued expenses;
    - b.	The net forward position, defined as all net amounts under forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the interest and principal on currency swaps;
    - c.	The delta equivalent amounts of currency options;
    - d.	Guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be exercised and are likely to be irrevocable;
    - e.	At the discretion of the IAIG, net future income and expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged;
    - f.	Any other item representing a profit or loss in the foreign currency;
    - g.	Minus the amount of capital required locally to support the activities in the foreign currency, subject to a cap of 10% of net insurance liabilities in that currency.
- L2-231. The deduction referred to in point g) of paragraph L2-230 is applied to long positions only and does not change any long position to a short position. This deduction applies only if the IAIG has operations in the jurisdiction of the foreign currency.
- L2-232. The net open currency position excludes assets that are fully deducted from capital resources, and liabilities that qualify for inclusion in consolidated capital resources.
- L2-233. The net insurance liability reported for each currency consists of the current estimate net of any reinsurance assets, plus all deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the current estimate and reinsurance assets.
- L2-234. Forward currency positions are valued at spot market exchange rates as at the reporting date.
- L2-235. The Currency risk charge is equal to the higher of the aggregated losses incurred under the following two scenarios:
    - a.	Scenario 1: all currencies in which the IAIG has a net long position decrease in value, while all of the currencies in which the IAIG has a net short position remain unchanged. The amount of the decrease of each foreign currency relative to the reporting currency is found in the currency stress matrix in Table 20 below. The decrease for currency pairs not listed in Table 20 is 60%.
    - b.	Scenario 2: all currencies in which the IAIG has a net short position increase in value, while all of the currencies in which the IAIG has a net long position remain unchanged. The amount of the increase of each foreign currency relative to the reporting currency is found in the currency stress matrix in Table 20 below. The increase for currency pairs not listed in Table 20 is 60%.
- L2-236. For each scenario, the losses by currency are aggregated using a correlation formula for which the assumed correlation of losses between each pair of foreign currencies is 50%.

### 5.3.7	Asset Concentration risk
- L1-128. The Asset Concentration risk charge is an incremental risk charge above the Market and Credit risk charges, which acknowledges that assets held by the IAIG are not perfectly diversified. Assets in separate accounts or where the investment risks fully flow-through<GTooltipIcon desc=" Not considering any guarantee to policyholders that may exist on the value of the overall investment fund(s) such as on variable annuity products."/> to policyholders are excluded from the calculation of the Asset Concentration risk charge.
- L1-129. For real estate, a specified factor is applied to assets in excess of specified threshold. The methodology to calculate the Asset Concentration risk charge is specified in the Level 2 text.
- L2-237. The methodology to calculate the Asset Concentration risk charge is specified below.

#### 5.3.7.1	Assets other than real estate
- L2-238. For assets other than real estate, the Asset Concentration risk charge is calculated as:
<GMath title ="Asset Concentration risk charge-other than real estate">
$$
f\times \left( \cfrac{\sum_{E_i \gt T}(E_i-T)(d \cdot K_i^{eq}+K_i^{cr})}{d \cdot K^{eq} +K^{cr}} + T\right)
$$
</GMath>
<GCmt>
- ‚Ä¢ $f = 0.71656$ ;
- ‚Ä¢ $d = 0.95$;
- ‚Ä¢ $E_i$ is the net exposure to group of connected counterparties $i$;
- ‚Ä¢ $T$ is an exposure threshold determined by the IAIG in such a way that the number of groups of connected counterparties $i$ for which $E_i \gt T$is equal to or greater than 10 but does not exceed 100;
- ‚Ä¢ $K_i^{eq}$ is the Equity risk charge associated with counterparty $i$, before diversification and management actions;
- ‚Ä¢ $K_i^{cr}$ is the Credit risk charge associated with counterparty $i$, before diversification and management actions;
- ‚Ä¢ $K^{eq}$ is the total Equity risk charge of the IAIG, before diversification and management actions; and
- ‚Ä¢ $K^{cr}$ is the total Credit risk charge of the IAIG, before diversification and management actions.
</GCmt>
- L2-239. Groups of connected counterparties are determined according to the definition provided by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( <GTooltip label="BCBS" desc="As specified in the BCBS publication Supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures (April 2014), which also outlines criteria for assessing whether ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô or ‚Äòeconomic interdependence‚Äô exists."/>). Specifically, two or more natural or legal persons are considered a group of connected counterparties if at least one of the following criteria is satisfied:
    - a.	Control relationship: one of the counterparties, directly or indirectly, has control over the other(s); or
    - b.	Economic interdependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial problems, the other(s), as a result, would also be likely to encounter financial problems.
- L2-240. Exposures to national governments are excluded from the Asset Concentration risk charge calculation. Public sector exposures, not issued or guaranteed by a national government, such as provincial, state or municipal debt, are included within the Asset Concentration risk charge calculation with their corresponding Credit and Equity risk charges.
- L2-241. The determination of the gross counterparty exposures includes both on- and off-balance sheet positions, and considers the following:
    - a.	Exposures to reinsurance counterparties are included on a pre-stress basis<GTooltipIcon desc="The contingent risk associated with catastrophe scenarios is not included in the exposure."/>;
    - b.	The determination of OTC derivatives exposures is based on a credit-equivalent basis, as applicable, and exposures to central counterparties are excluded;
    - c.	Exposures are based on a look-through approach for investment funds and structured products;
    - d.	Non-affiliated (external) guarantees, commitments, bank deposits, receivables and any other items subject to the possibility of financial loss due to counterparty default are included; and
    - e.	Gross exposures are calculated based upon the MAV basis described in section 3, except where otherwise specified.
- L2-242. The determination of net counterparty exposures considers the following:
    - a.	Exposures from assets held in separate accounts or life insurance contracts where the investment risks fully flow-through to policyholders are excluded. Nevertheless, assets backing any guarantees to policyholders are included;
    - b.	Asset exposures may be netted against liability exposures to the extent that they are subject to a legally enforceable right of offset;
    - c.	For exposures covered by collateral or unconditional and irrevocable guarantees, the substitution approach specified in sections 5.4.2.1.1 and 5.4.2.2.3 may be used for the portion of the exposure covered by the collateral or the guarantees. The exposure to the primary counterparty is then replaced by the exposure to the collateral or guarantor. This approach should also be used for bank deposits if an explicit guarantee (such as a national government guarantee) exists. Where national government exposures are substituted for corporate exposures, the corresponding amounts are excluded from the determination of the Asset Concentration risk charge, in line with the provisions of paragraph L2-240; and
    - d.	For collateralised non-life reinsurance exposures, the haircut approach specified in section 5.4.2.1.2 is used in lieu of the substitution approach. The exposure to the reinsurer is the adjusted net exposure calculated in section 5.4 on Credit risk. The collateral received is excluded from the counterparty exposure. However, the asset concentration risk for the collateral calculated on a standalone basis is one component of the haircut applied to the collateral.

#### 5.3.7.2	Real estate
- L2-243. In order to calculate the Asset Concentration risk charge for real estate, property exposures are determined on the basis of single property, or group of properties within a 250 metres radius, including exposures from both direct and indirect holdings (such as funds of properties).
- L2-244. The Asset Concentration risk charge for any property exposure as defined above is calculated as 25% of the net property exposure exceeding 3% of the IAIG‚Äôs total net investment assets relating to insurance activities. The net property exposures are calculated in line with paragraphs L2-241 and L2-242.
