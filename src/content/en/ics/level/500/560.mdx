## 5.6	Aggregation / diversification of ICS risk charges
- L1-139. ICS Risk charges are aggregated together using multiple levels:
    - •	A top-level aggregation between major risk categories (Life risk, Non-life risk, Catastrophe risk, Market risk, Credit risk and Operational risk) using a correlation matrix;
    - •	A medium-level aggregation between the sub-risks of Life risk, Catastrophe risk and Market risk, using correlation matrices; and
    - •	An aggregation within individual risk charges (eg interest rate risk, non-life risk).
- L1-140. The aggregation of risk charges incorporates a degree of diversification between the individual risks, based on a specified dependency between the risks.
- L1-141. Correlation matrices are specified for the aggregation of the individual Life Risk charges and the aggregation of individual Market risks charges. A top-level correlation matrix is specified for the aggregation of Life, Non-Life, Catastrophe, Market and Credit risk charges. The Operational risk charge is then added to that aggregate to determine the overall ICS insurance risk charge.
- L1-142. The correlation matrices used to aggregate the ICS risk charges are specified in the Level 2 text. The aggregation approach used within individual risk charges is described in the specific risk section in the Level 1 and 2 texts.
- L2-335. The top-level aggregation matrix between major risk categories is:

|| Life | Non-life | Catastrophe | Market | Credit |
|:-----------:|:----:|:-----:|:------:|:---:|:---:|
| **Life**        | 100% | 0%   | 25%   | 25%  | 25%  |
| **Non-life**    | 0%   | 100% | 25%   | 25%  | 25%  |
| **Catastrophe** | 25%  | 25%  | 100%  | 25%  | 25%  |
| **Market**      | 25%  | 25%  | 25%   | 100% | 25%  |
| **Credit**      | 25%  | 25%  | 25%   | 25%  | 100% |
