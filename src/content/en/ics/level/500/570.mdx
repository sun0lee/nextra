    - a.	For consolidated banking entities, the capital requirement is calculated in accordance with the Basel regime.
    - b.	For consolidated non-banking entities, it is equal to the following:
      - i.	The maximum of the sectoral capital requirement and 15% of three-year average [gross income](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs128.pdf).<GTooltipIcon desc="For asset managers, gross income relates only to third-party asset management, not the management of the IAIG’s own assets where the risk is captured elsewhere.

      - ii.	At the group wide supervisor’s request, the maximum of the sectoral capital requirement and the Operational Risk Capital Requirement as calculated under the Basel regime calculation for operational risk.30 If additional, material risks of the entity are not appropriately captured by either operational risk-type charge, the group wide supervisor may require an additional risk charge to cover these risks.
