title: 7.3  Internal models
---
### 7.3.1  Overall requirements
- L1-153. Whenever internal models are allowed as an Other Method for calculating the ICS capital requirement, the group-wide supervisor (GWS) considers how the Balance Sheet, used within the internal model, complies with the requirements for the calculation of the balance sheet in the standard method, currently set out within section 3 on Market-Adjusted Valuation. In doing so, the GWS should ensure consistency between the approaches used for the determination of capital requirements and capital resources.
- L1-154. Whenever internal models are allowed as an Other Method for calculating the ICS capital requirement, their use is subject to the requirements specified in sections 7.3.2 to 7.3.5.

### 7.3.2  General provisions on the use of an internal model to determine regulatory capital requirements
#### 7.3.2.1  Internal model approval process
##### 7.3.2.1.1  Framework for application and review process
- L1-155. The GWS sets up an internal model application process (IMAP). The IMAP enables the GWS to decide whether the IAIG may use a specified internal model to calculate its group-wide PCR under the ICS.
- L2-355. The GWS ensures that the IMAP is open by allowing any IAIG under its supervision to apply for the use of an internal model to calculate its PCR and by stating, as the case may be, the basis for its decision to reject the application.
- L2-356. The GWS is responsible for the decision to approve or reject the IM application of an IAIG under its supervision.
- L2-357. The GWS may wish to consult with other members of the supervisory college on the review process, the outcome of the application process and the on-going supervision.
- L2-358. Finally, a model is not considered for approval unless the IAIG can demonstrate a comprehensive and effective approach to risk management which includes establishing and successfully achieving an internal capital target greater than the regulatory capital requirement as indicated by the internal model.

###### 7.3.2.1.1.1  Pre-application process
- L2-359. The GWS may choose to develop a pre-application process to indicate the IAIG's preparedness to undergo an internal model review and outline criteria that should be satisfied before an internal model application. The process may consist of the IAIG's submission and the GWS's review of the following four items:

  ||process|desc |
  |--|--|--|
  |a)|Self-Assessment | consists of a number of qualitative and quantitative affirmations, with a brief narrative explaining how the statistical quality test, calibration test, validation standards, use test, governance and documentation standards are met|
  |b)|Overview of internal model | provides the GWS with an introduction to the model and its role within the IAIG's risk management framework|
  |c)|Model Demonstration | provides a high-level overview of the internal model’s functionality; and|
  |d)|Documentation Gap Analysis |initial assessment of an IAIG’s ability to satisfy the GWS’s information request.|

- L2-360. The pre-application process aims to indicate the IAIG’s preparedness to undergo an internal model review and is not necessarily an indication of internal model approval. The GWS may provide feedback regarding any significant internal model deficiencies as soon as possible during the pre- application and review processes so that the IAIG may have the opportunity to resolve these issues before the start of the application process.

###### 7.3.2.1.1.2  Application process
- L2-361. The internal model application and review process can comprise several stages, including at least the following:

<GCallout severity="info" title ="The internal model application and review process">

  ||process|desc |
  |--|--|--|
  |a)|Application for internal model approval | an application for the approval from the GWS to use a specified internal model for the determination of the group-wide PCR of the IAIG|
  |b)|Provision of information | quantitative and qualitative information as specified by the GWS|
  |c)|Internal model review process | thorough model review by the GWS on an on-site and/or off-site basis, with extensive dialogue and requests for supplemental information|
  |d)|Decision on the outcome of the process|
  |e)|Communication of results | communication relating to the GWS assessment of IAIG’s internal model and response to the application to use the internal model for the calculation of the group-wide PCR.|

<Accordion activeIndex={[0]}>
<AccordionTab header="1)  Application for internal model approval ">
  - L2-362. Upon completion of the pre-application process, if any, and confirmation of the GWS, the IAIG may proceed with a formal application for the approval of its internal model. Depending on the GWS’ request, the application may include:
    - a)  A cover letter requesting the approval to use internal model to calculate the group-wide PCR starting from a specified target date signed by the Board of Directors or its representative; with a statement confirming that the information is accurate and complete and that no relevant facts were omitted; a general explanation of the model, including its structure, scope, and how it should be integrated into the standard method to calculate the group-wide PCR in case of a partial internal model; and the contact details for relevant personnel to whom additional information requests can be submitted;
    - b)  An explanation of how the IAIG meets the criteria of the statistical quality test, calibration test, validation standards, use test, governance and documentation standards;
    - c)  An explanation of the model and how all material and quantifiable risks of the IAIG are covered;
    - d)  For partial internal model:
      - a.  an explanation of the model;
      - b.  demonstration that all material and quantifiable risks of the scope are covered;
      - c.  the reason for the limited scope; and
      - d.  plan for the expansion of the scope, if any
    - e)  A justification of risks not covered by the model but considered in the standard method taking into consideration materiality;
    - f)  The allocation of the risks in the internal model according to the risks categories of the ICS standard method;
    - g)  An assessment of the proposed approach’s material strengths, weaknesses, and limitations to determine the group-wide PCR. The identified weaknesses and limitations should be accompanied by a plan on how to mitigate them;
    - h)  An inventory of all the documents and sets of evidence included in the application organised in a clear manner to a knowledgeable third party;
    - i)  The technical documentation of the internal model;
    - j)  The results of the proposed approach to calculating the group-wide PCR and the results of the ICS standard method of the last three years;
    - k)  A plan for information disclosure to stakeholders;
    - l)  The results of the profit and loss attribution of the last three years;
    - m)  A log file with the model changes
    - n)  Planned future changes;
    - o)  A log file with the validation findings; and
    - p)  A proposal for model change policy.

  The documents for the application should be complete and allow a knowledgeable third party to understand the multiple dimensions of the model and collect evidence for the assessment, seeking to minimise additional document requests by the GWS. They should include, but are not limited to:
    - a)  the technical specifications of the model, and justification of the modelling choices;
    - b)  all relevant policies and guidelines related to different aspects of the model, including governance, calibration and validation;
    - c)  evidence of compliance with the governance and guidelines, model use and validation; and
    - d)  Integration in the ICS standard method in the case of partial internal model. 
    
</AccordionTab>
<AccordionTab header="2) Provision of information ">

  - L2-363. For the GWS to properly consider an internal model application, the IAIG should provide complete and timely responses to all quantitative and qualitative information requests.
  - The information submission process can comprise several stages and include:
    - a)  a standardised information request to be completed at the time of application
    - b)  a more specific request of information, which will take into account the IAIG’s unique attributes, to be completed soon after the application is submitted; and
    - c)  supplemental requests are to be completed at various stages during the review process to further assist in evaluating the IAIG’s internal model.
    
</AccordionTab>
<AccordionTab header="3)  Internal model review process ">
  - L2-364. The review process involves off-site monitoring and may involve on-site inspections. L2-365. The internal model review process is expected to include the following elements:
    - a)  review of any documentation related to the internal model;
    - b)  review of responses to information requests;
    - c)  detailed model demonstrations by the IAIG; and
    - d)  discussions with the IAIG’s management and staff.
  - L2-366. As part of the internal model review, the IAIG is required to provide a comparison of the group-wide PCR calculated using the internal model with the one resulting from the ICS standard method at the time of the internal model review.
  - L2-367. Also, the GWS approves the allocation of the risks in the internal model according to the risks categories of the ICS standard method. The IAIG is able to identify the risks not covered by the model but considered in the standard method and provide justification for not including these risks in the internal model.

    
</AccordionTab>
<AccordionTab header="4)  Interaction with supervisory college ">
  - L2-368. During the internal model approval process, the GWS keeps the supervisory college informed of the status of the process and collect relevant views from other involved supervisors, e.g., local specificities such as tax rules and product features. Whilst the GWS may consider any information received from other involved supervisors, the GWS retains the responsibility to decide on the internal model application concerning the IAIG.
    
</AccordionTab>
<AccordionTab header="5)  Decision on the outcome of the process ">
  - L2-369. Below are listed the possible outcomes of the process:
    - a)  Approved;
    - b)  Not approved; and
    - c)  Approved conditionally
  - L2-370. Should the application be approved, the GWS states the effective date and any applicable conditions. The GWS may approve conditionally and allow the IAIG to commence using its internal model to calculate the PCR if the areas that require further improvement or review do not prevent the approval of the IAIG’s internal model application. Conditions may include capital floors based on the ICS, more conservative model parameters or design features, capital add-ons or further reviews by the GWS, the IAIG or a third party.
  - L2-371. If the application is unlikely to be approved, GWS communicates this to the IAIG so the latter can resolve the issues in a reasonable timeframe. If the identified issues cannot be resolved within a reasonable time, the GWS does not approve the internal model application.
    
</AccordionTab>
<AccordionTab header="6)  Communication of the outcome of the decision ">
  - L2-372. Before communicating the results to the IAIG, the GWS shares the results of its findings with the supervisory college to see if any issues need to be addressed. Moreover, the GWS discloses to the supervisory college the justification of risks not covered by the model but considered in the standard method.
  - L2-373. After the review process is complete, the GWS sends a formal response to the IAIG regarding the application to use the proposed internal model to calculate its group-wide PCR.
  - L2-374. If the internal model is approved, the GWS works with the IAIG to communicate the decision to the public. Particular attention should be given to the clarity of the approved internal model’s scope and the differences with the ICS standard method’s underlying assumptions when possible. If the IAIG uses an approved internal model, it does not revert to using the standard method to calculate the PCR unless authorised and/or directed by the GWS to do so.

#### 7.3.2.2  Post-approval monitoring and control process
- L1-156. Following approval of an internal model for calculating the group-wide PCR, the GWS requires some additional reporting regarding the internal model. The GWS conducts periodic reviews to ensure that the internal model continues to meet the criteria of statistical quality test, calibration test, validation standards, use test, governance and documentation standards.
- L2-375. Post-approval reporting will enable the GWS to monitor internal model developments and conduct relevant analysis and benchmarking exercises. The GWS should include the elements necessary for benchmarking exercise in the information request.
- L2-376. Specific reporting requirements relating to the internal model will be established during the model review process. The GWS works with the IAIG in developing data submission templates for post-approval reporting purposes. While most reporting will be required annually, some circumstances may require more frequent filings. Reporting requirements may include:
  - a)  standard periodic internal model output;
  - b)  ICS standard method output;
  - c)  narrative discussing previous and future planned changes and developments to the internal model;
  - d)  updated model documentation; and
  - e)  new or updated validation reports.
- L2-377. The IAIG cooperates with the GWS to establish an appropriate policy relating to post- approval monitoring and reporting major and minor changes, including the materiality threshold in relation to major and minor model modifications as described in section 7.3.4.1 on the model change policy
- L2-378. Moreover, the GWS ensures that the IAIG establishes an appropriate policy relating to communication and public disclosure on model results and changes post-approval.
- L1-157. As part of the supervisory process the GWS reviews the model post approval regularly to assess whether the internal model deviates from the assumptions, portfolio characteristics, structure or parameterisation used in previously approved versions, and ad-hoc reviews in case such deviations have been identified.
- L2-379. Where relevant, the post-approval internal model reviews by the GWS will focus on the portions of the internal model that have changed. However, the GWS reserves the right to conduct a comprehensive review on an already approved internal model at its discretion and may resort to a capital add-on in case the deviation is material.
- L2-380. Should any conditions of an internal model approval be breached, the GWS may allow the IAIG a reasonable time to correct such breach and work with the IAIG to resolve any issues. If these outstanding issues cannot be corrected within the allotted time, the GWS may revoke its approval of the internal model.
- L2-381. In the event that the GWS revokes approval of an internal model, the affected IAIG may reapply once all internal model deficiencies have been resolved.
- L2-382. The GWS should cooperate with other involved supervisors as part of its internal model supervisory review. The GWS should engage in collaborative model review efforts with other members of the supervisory college to maximise the effectiveness and consistency of outcomes of the ICS.
