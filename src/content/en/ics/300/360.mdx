## 3.6	Asset concentration risk
### 3.6.1	Definition
155. The Asset Concentration risk charge is an incremental risk charge above the Market and Credit risk charges, which acknowledges that assets held by IAIGs are not perfectly diversified.

### 3.6.2 ICS methodology
156. The Asset concentration risk charge calculation involves a risk charge for:
  - a. real estate; and
  - b. assets other than real estate.
157. The sum of a) and b) above is the risk charge for asset concentration.

### 3.6.3	Calibration
#### 3.6.3.1	Real estate
158. Due to insufficient data expert judgement was applied. The radius of 250 metres to identify group of properties to identify single exposure are based on the values identified for the terrorist attack submodule. The level of 3% is based on expert judgement and the stress level is consistent with the level of stress for real estate.
#### 3.6.3.2 Assets other than real estate
##### 3.6.3.2.1	Methodology
159. The methodology is based on the paper Granularity Adjustment for Regulatory Capital Assessment by Gordy and Luetkebohmert.15
160. The paper provides an approximation for the theoretical framework of a granularity adjustment, which is further reduced to a simplified granularity adjustment 𝐺𝐴̃ 
161. Further details can be found in the paper. Roughly speaking 𝑠⬚can be interpreted as the portfolio share, 𝐾𝑖 as the unexpected loss, 𝑅𝑖 as the expected loss. 𝐶𝑖 is a term depending on the variance and expected value of loss given default (LGD) of asset 𝑖 and 𝛿 is parameter that
depends on the quantile of the distribution and a so-called precision parameter 𝜉 (which is proposed to be set to 0.25 in the paper).

##### 3.6.3.2.2	Assumptions
162. The following assumptions (going beyond the assumptions made in the paper) were made to determine the risk charge for the ICS.
 - a. Assume 𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑖 = 𝐿𝐺𝐷 = 0.45 to determine 𝐶𝑖. This choice is consistent with the assumptions for Credit risk.
 - b. 𝑅𝑖 is relatively small compared to 𝐾𝑖
 - c. 𝐾𝑖 + 𝑅𝑖 is the ICS Equity and Credit risk charge.
