# 2. Insurance risks

## 2.1	Life insurance risks
### 2.1.1	Definition
7. Life risk charges are applicable to life business and similar to life health business and consist of the following five sub-risk charges.
- a. Mortality risk: risk of losses due to actual mortality rates higher than expected;
- b. Longevity risk: risk of losses due to actual mortality rates lower than expected;
- c. Morbidity/Disability risk: risk of losses due to unexpected changes in the level, trend or volatility of disability, sickness and morbidity rates;
- d. Lapse risk: risk of losses due to unexpected changes in the level or volatility of rates of policy lapses, terminations, renewals and surrenders;
- e. Expense risk: risk of losses due to unexpected changes in the incidence of expense incurred.

### 2.1.2	ICS Methodology
8. For each of the five sub-risks listed above, stress factors are applied to the parameters underpinning the calculation of current estimates, in order to generate stressed balance sheets in line with the ICS target criteria – a probability of occurrence of 0.5% over a 1-year time horizon.
9. The calculation of all sub-risk charges are based on the following geographical segmentation, with respect to the location where risks are written:
- a. EEA and Switzerland;
- b. US and Canada;
- c. China;
- d. Japan;
- e. Other developed markets; and
- f. Other emerging markets.
10. The five Life insurance sub-risks charges are aggregated with a correlation matrix; the correlation factors are based on expert judgement whether the corelation between two sub-risks is negative, negligible, low, medium or high.
11. For each of the five sub-risks, the risk charge is calculated both with and without the impact of management actions.
12. The design of Life risks was informed by Field Testing exercises from 2014 to 2019, confidential reporting exercises from 2020 to 2024, as well as public consultations on ICS in 2014, 2016 and 2018. The calibration of Life risks was supported by targeted data collections in 2016, 2018 2019 and 2022 (all risks), as well as 2015 and 2017 (Morbidity/disability risk).

### 2.1.3	Calibration of risks
13. To inform the calibration of Life risks, supplementary data collections were run in 2018, 2019 and 2022, together with the Field Testing / confidential reporting data collections. In the context of those supplementary Life data collections, Volunteer Groups were requested to provide data covering at least 10 consecutive years (in 2018 and 2019), and 13 consecutive years (in 2022).
 
#### 2.1.3.1	Mortality risk
14. The calculation of the mortality risk charge is based on a scenario of general permanent increase in mortality rates.
15. Based on a review of existing risk-based supervisory frameworks, and after field testing different factors between 10% and 15%, the stress factor was provisionally set at 12.5% for all regions.
16. In 2018 and 2019, data were collected from IAIGs in order to inform a potential refinement of the calibration. Based on those data and on the assumption that the variable  $\dfrac{A}{E}-1$ (where $A$ and $E$ respectively denote actual and expected claims, due to all causes, incurred in each financial year) follows a normal distribution (for which observations are independent and identically distributed), the following 99.5th percentiles<GTooltipIcon desc=" In practice, the 99.5th percentiles were determined as 2.58 times the historical standard deviation calculated for the A/E -1 variable."/> were calculated for mortality rates:
- a. 6% for business written in Japan;
- b. 15% for business written in China; and
- c. 10% for business written in other developed markets.
17. Data for the Japanese market were considered sufficient evidence, with over 10 years of history; therefore, it was decided to set the stress factor for business written in Japan to 10% (including a prudence margin based on expert judgement). The appropriateness of that level was confirmed by data collected in 2022.
18. For business written in China, the 2019 and 2022 data collections provided evidence of a risk factor between 13% and 27%; the risk factor was therefore set to 15%.
19. For other developed markets, data collected in 2022 supported a 12.5% risk factor.
20. For US and Canada and other emerging markets, the lack of historical data provided in all data collections did not allow for an adjustment of the calibration. Therefore, based on expert judgement the stress factor was aligned with other developed markets (12.5%).
21. For EEA and Switzerland, 10 years of historical data collected through the 2019 data collection showed that a 12.5% risk factor was appropriate. Data collected in 2022 continue to support this conclusion.

#### 2.1.3.2	Longevity risk
22. The calculation of the longevity risk charge is based on a scenario of a permanent decrease in mortality rates.
23. Based on results of data provided by IAIGs for the calibration exercise in 2016, a stress factor of 17.5% across all regions was specified<GTooltipIcon desc="The stress factor was chosen in a way to cover implicitly the trend and volatility components of the longevity risk, since the choice was made not to include explicitly those components in the design. This approach was considered striking an appropriate balance between complexity and risk sensitivity."/> for the 2017 Field Testing. In the absence of any evidence that this level of stress is inappropriate, the 17.5% factor has remained unchanged since then.

#### 2.1.3.3	Morbidity and Disability risk
24. For the calculation of the morbidity/disability risk charge, the business is split: (resulting in eight segments (4 types of guarantee and for each type, 2 terms of contract).)
- a. By type of guarantee:
  - i. Medical expenses (Category 1)
  - ii. Lump sum in case of a health event (Category 2)
  - iii. Short-term recurring payments (Category 3)
  - iv. Long-term recurring payments (Category 4)
- b. By term of contract:
  - i. Short-term (up to 5 years)
  - ii. Long-term (more than 5 years)
25.	For segments in categories 1 to 3, stress factors are applied either to inception / recovery rates (when those are explicitly used for the modelling of claim costs) or otherwise directly to the expected amount of future claims. For segments in category 4, stress factors are applicable to the assumptions underlying the calculation of future claims (inception rates and recovery rates).
26.	The distinction between short-term and long-term contracts was introduced to reflect that claim amounts over a short period are likely more volatile than over a longer period.
27.	All stresses are assumed to occur simultaneously, therefore risk charges for those four categories are added together.

##### 2.1.3.3.1	Medical expenses (Category 1)
28.	For short-term contracts, an initial calibration based on 10-year historical data provided by IAIGs was undertaken in 2015. The calibration methodology consisted of calculating, for a number of portfolios, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by average) over time of the following ratios:
- a.	number of claims<GTooltipIcon desc="In this section on Morbidity and Disability risk the term claims encompasses claims due to all causes incurred in a given financial year."/> per insured people; and
- b.	claim amounts to premiums.
29.	The calculated coefficients of variation showed an important heterogeneity and averaged at 12.1% (ratio based on number counts) and 5.3% (ratio based on amounts). Based on those results, a figure of 8% was chosen to represent the typical coefficient of variation for Category 1 products. Under a Gaussian assumption, this 8% coefficient translated into a 21% stress factor (99.5 percentile), which was rounded down to 20%.
30.	For long-term contracts, a calibration was done in 2017 based on an additional data collection from IAIGs, also covering 10 years of history. A 99.5% quantile was calculated based on the historical distribution of claims to gross written premiums. Under a Gaussian assumption, those data provided evidence of a risk factor of 7%. Finally, a margin for prudence was incorporated and an 8% stress factor was set.

##### 2.1.3.3.2	Lump sum in case of a health event (Category 2)
31.	For Category 2 short-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 short- term contracts, based on data collected in 2015. Both sets of ratios showed evidence of an average coefficient of variation close to 8%. However, given the significant variability of those coefficients across portfolios (from 1% to 28%), some conservatism was introduced and a value of 10% was chosen as a typical coefficient of variation, resulting in a 99.5% stress factor of 26%, rounded down to 25%.
32.	For Category 2 long-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 long-term contracts, based on data collected in 2017. This approach resulted in the choice of a 20% stress factor (30% based on number of policies, 19% based on expected claims).
33.	An additional data analysis conducted in 2018 and 2022 on long-term Category 2 business written in Japan provided evidence supporting a risk factor of 15%.

##### 2.1.3.3.3	Short-term recurring payments (Category 3)
34.	For Category 3 short-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 short- term contracts, based on data collected in 2015. The set of ratios based on the number of insured people showed a coefficient of variation slightly above 8% on average, and 4% for the set based on premiums. Given the high level of discrepancy across portfolios (between 0.7% and 20%, after exclusion of obvious outliers), a typical coefficient of variation was set at 7%, which translated into a stress factor of 18%, rounded up to 20%.
35.	For Category 3 long-term contracts, the same approach was applied as for Category 1 long-term contracts, based on data collected in 2017. This approach resulted in setting a 12% stress factor (26% based on number of policies, 12% based on expected claims).
36.	The data analyses run in 2018 and 2022 showed evidence that the 99.5% quantile for long-term Category 3 business in Japan was slightly below 10%. Therefore, it was decided to set the stress factor for business written in Japan to 10%.

##### 2.1.3.3.4	Long-term recurring payments (Category 4)
37.	For short-term contracts, the calibration data collected was limited: only one Volunteer Group provided data covering at least 10 consecutive years in 2019, and none in 2022. Therefore, stresses for short-term contracts were determined by reference to Solvency II, which features the same target criteria (99.5% VaR over a one-year time horizon).
38.	For long-term contracts, the same stress factors were chosen as a starting point, and a 20% haircut, based on expert judgement, was applied to the inception rate stress factor to account for a lower volatility of claims over the long run.

#### 2.1.3.4	Lapse risk
39.	The calculation of the lapse risk charge involves three different scenarios:
- a. A permanent increase in future lapse rates (level and trend, up);
- b. A permanent decrease in future lapse rates (level and trend, down); and
- c. An immediate surrender of a fraction of the in-force policies.
40.	For the two scenarios of the level and trend component, an initial placeholder calibration (40% relative increase / decrease in the current estimate lapse rates) was determined based on expert judgement. Based on a Gaussian assumption for the distribution of the variable $\dfrac{A}{E}-1$(ratio of actual to expected number of lapses incurred over the financial year), 10-year historical data submitted by IAIGs in 2018 provided evidence that the 99.5th percentile of lapse rates for business written in Japan should be between 12% and 20%; this evidence was confirmed by the data collected in 2019. Therefore, the stress factor for the level and trend component for business written in Japan was revised to 20%. The data collected in 2019 and 2022 confirmed the appropriateness of the stress factors for Europe, Japan, China and other developed markets. No sufficient data was obtained for other regions.
41.	The mass lapse scenario stress factors are 30% (retail policies) and 50% (non-retail). These were determined based on expert judgement after a review of various jurisdictional solvency regimes including those from Solvency II, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Singapore and Japan.
42.	Depending on the portfolio structure, either the mass lapse or the level and trend scenario could be the relevant 0.5% probability scenario for a given IAIG. Therefore, the maximum between those two scenarios is retained as the lapse risk charge. For the same reason, the higher of the level and trend up and level and trend down results is retained as the level and trend component.

#### 2.1.3.5	Expense risk
43.	The calculation of the expense risk charge involves two simultaneous scenarios:
- a. An increase in the unit expense amount by a factor $x$;
- b. An increase in the level of inflation of expenses by a factor $y$.
44.	An initial placeholder calibration of those two scenarios was chosen by expert judgement and a review of this calibration was undertaken in 2017. This took into account:
- a. The responses to the 2016 ICS public consultation;
- b. 9 to 12-year historical data submitted by IAIGs in 2016; and
- c. The Generally Recognised Expense Table (GRET) study published by the Society of Actuaries in the US, based on data from 2008 to 2014.
45.	The review concluded that:
- a. A permanent 3% stress on inflation for China and emerging markets is not realistic, and should be graded down over time;
- b. The order of magnitude of the 𝑥 factor is 10%; and
- c. The global level of 99.5% stress (unit expense + inflation) in the US should be approximately 16%.
46.	In addition, a review based on Field Testing data and conducted in 2018 showed that a 6% factor for unit expense risk in Japan was appropriate.
47.	Based on those considerations, it was decided to introduce a downgrading of the inflation stress after year 10 for Other developed markets, China and Other emerging markets. Other factors were considered globally appropriate. Data collected in 2022 did not provide evidence of calibration inappropriateness.


## 2.2	Non-Life risk
### 2.2.1	Definition
48.	Non-Life risks capital requirement is intended to ensure that IAIG’s hold sufficient capital to protect against the 99.5th percentile of non-life losses over a one-year time horizon. The non-life requirement is split between the risk associated with timing, frequency and severity of future insured events (premium risk) and the risk associated with future payments on insured events that have already occurred (claims reserve risk).

### 2.2.2	ICS methodology
#### 2.2.2.1	Risks and exposures
49.	All risk posed by insured events that occur during the one-year time horizon (including on policies that are not recognized on the ICS balance sheet) is included within premium risk. Risk posed by running off insured losses beyond the one-year time horizon is excluded from the ICS. While the ICS allows for a range of other methodologies, this calibration exercise assumes that premium liabilities are valued using an unearned premium allocation approach (see 2.2.3.1). Risk that profits on future policies (including due to lapse, cancellation and changes in premium liability methodology) differs from that currently recognised on the ICS balance sheet is assumed to be zero.
![aaa](/ics/cal49.png)
50.	Future events that are included in the ICS catastrophe risk component (e.g. natural catastrophe) are excluded but all other causes of losses (including catastrophic events that do not have a separate capital requirement) are included in premium risk. The risks associated with catastrophic events that have already occurred (including latent liability events) are included within reserve risk.
51.	The ICS Non-Life capital requirement uses a factor-based approach where a factor for each insurance segment is multiplied by an exposure. The exposure base for premium risk is the expected premium to be earned during the one-year time horizon. As an approximation, IAIG’s can use the net written premium from the prior year. The exposure base for reserve risk is the net current claims estimate. This is the discounted future cashflows on insurance claims that have already occurred including expenses and net of the impact of reinsurance.

#### 2.2.2.2	Segmentation
52.	To make the most use of existing reporting, ICS segments are based on the same jurisdictional lines of business as used in reporting to local supervisors. For purposes of diversification, segments are grouped into risk category (Liability-like, Property-like, Motor-like, Other) and region (EEA and Switzerland, US and Canada, China, Japan, Other Developed Markets and Other Emerging Markets).

#### 2.2.2.3	Aggregation/Diversification
53.	Diversification is applied between Premium and Claims Reserve risks, within and between each of the four IAIS categories, and between geographical regions. No geographic diversification is applied within a single geographic region.
54.	The multi-step aggregation is performed in the following order:
- a. The first step of aggregation is to combine each ICS segment’s Premium risk and Claims Reserve risk charges, applying a 25% correlation between the Premium and Claims Reserve risk charges. Mortgage business and credit business are added across all regions and then included in the calculation of Real Estate risk and Credit risk, respectively.
- b. The second step of aggregation is within categories, where the following correlation matrix is applied across segments of a given category:
  |Categories|Correlation factor<br/>between segments <br/>of the category|
  |:--:|:--:|
  |Liability-like |50%|
  |Motor-like |75%|
  |Property-like |50%|
  |Other |25%|

- c. The third step of aggregation is within a region, where a correlation matrix is applied to each of the four aggregated IAIS categories’ risk charge (applying a 50% correlation between ICS categories).
- d. The fourth step of aggregation is across regions, where a correlation matrix is applied to each region’s total risk charge (applying a 25% correlation between regions).

### 2.2.3	Calibration
#### 2.2.3.1	Data and assumptions
55.	The factors were calculated with assumption that:
- a.the only changes to the balance sheet will be from premiums received during the one-year time horizon will be from losses paid on existing policies and from changes to the estimates the non-life current estimate.
- b.All other assets and liabilities (including the margin over the non-life current estimate), discount rates and exchange rates are constant.
- c.All insurers use an unearned premium (aka premium allocation approach) for calculating premium liabilities with an expected combined ratio of 100%.
56.	Factors were calculated for any segment where data was available for at least three separate insurers. For each insurer, a minimum of 8 years of data was required. (Typical reported triangles include 10 years of data; for US segments, Schedule P’s were combined to produce 20 years of loss history.) Data from “minor lines” (i.e. when a segment is less than 1% of an insurer’s portfolio) was excluded as it was often not representative of the typical risk profile for IAIG’s within that segment.
57.	Factors were calculated by fitting a lognormal distribution to data from loss triangles. Data points within each segment were centred on a common mean and assumed to have the same standard deviation.

#### 2.2.3.2	Sources
58.	Where possible, data that has been collected in consistent and complete manner as part of a local reporting requirements was used. Data was provided by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada), Financial Services Agency (Japan), Financial Services Commission (Korea), Monetary Authority of Singapore, Prudential Regulatory Authority (UK) and National Association of Insurance Commissioners (USA). Further requests were made to volunteer IAIG’s during the ICS Field Testing process to allow for calibration of factors for jurisdictions where supervisors have only recently begun to collect such data.
 


#### 2.2.3.3	Premium risk
59.	For premium risk, a lognormal distribution was fit to the ultimate loss ratio (as evaluated after one year) for each segment. The factor was the 99.5th percentile of the distribution less the expected value. Each loss ratio was assumed to be independent and have an identical standard deviation. The mean loss ratio for each insurer is assumed to be unique: loss ratios were recentred on the segment (as opposed to insurer) mean before the distribution was fit. Where the ultimate loss ratio after one year was not available, the final ultimate loss ratio was used. For jurisdictions that were unable to separately report catastrophic and non-catastrophic loss, the distribution was fit on the total data and the resulting factor was reduced by 10%. While the historical data is undiscounted, the impact on the ICS balance sheet of a loss is discounted. Therefore, factors were reduced by a factor calculated using the payment pattern implied by triangles for each segment and the IAIS discount curves.

#### 2.2.3.4	Claims reserve risk
60.	For claims reserve risk, a lognormal distribution was fit to the distribution of reserve development for each segment’s loss triangles. Reserve development is defined as the change in the estimate of ultimate loss as a percentage of the outstanding reserve at the beginning of the year. Each year’s development, for all insurers within a segment, was assumed to be independent and identically distributed. The mean reserve development for each segment was recentred on 1 (i.e. reserves at the beginning of the year are assumed to be an accurate estimate of the expected ultimate loss). To allow for the most use of the available triangles, development was only calculated across four accident years. Analysis indicated that one-year development was distorted by the reserving cycle and so factors were calculated using the 99th percentile of two- year development.

#### 2.2.3.5	Selection of factors
61.	To ensure robustness, results were calculated and compared using a variety of statistical methods. To avoid impact of outliers created by reporting issues, final parameters for segments with sufficient data were estimated using the 50th and 90th percentiles of the segment’s distribution. All factors above 20% were rounded to the nearest 5%. All factors below 20% were rounded to the nearest 2.5% with a floor of 7.5%. An addition, using expert judgment, was made to the reserve risk factors for long-tailed lines to reflect potential for latent liability risk beyond that observed in the historical data.
62.	For segments without calibration data, a mapping approach was used to align them to the most similar segment for which factors were calibrated. Additionally, expert judgment was used to determine factors for the following segments:

|Region|Segment|updated Prem|updated Res|Original Mapping Prem|Original Mapping Res|
|--|--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Australia and NewZealand|Other type A|25%|20%|30%|20%|
|Australia and NewZealand|Other type B|35%|30%|30%|25%|
|Australia and NewZealand|consumer Credit|35%|15%|35%|25%|
|Australia and NewZealand|Motor damage and Liability|25%|15%|25%|20%|
|HongKong|Fire and Property damage|35%|20%|35%|30%|
|HongKong|General liability|45%|26%|45%|36%|
|HongKong|Treaty reinsurance|45%|25%|45%|35%|

#### 2.2.3.6	Aggregation/Diversification
63.	The correlation factors applied within the Non-Life risk component are based on expert judgement and aim at striking the right balance between simplicity and accuracy by appropriately capturing any tail correlation and non-linear dependencies between subcategories of Non-Life risks.


## 2.3	Catastrophe risk
### 2.3.1	Definition
64.	Catastrophe risk covers risks associated with claims events that have yet to occur, and are risks associated with low frequency/high severity events, often arising from an aggregation of multiple claims originating from a single source. Catastrophe risk affects life and non-life business.

### 2.3.2	ICS methodology
65.	Catastrophe risk is segmented at the risk/peril level. In the ICS, peril covers both naturally occurring perils (natural catastrophe) and man-made perils/scenarios (other catastrophe) and their consequences. It considers all losses arising as a consequence of events occurring at any point in time in the next 12 months and should take into account expected business volumes including expected new business to be written during the next 12 months.<GTooltipIcon desc="The catastrophe risk covers not only the main peril (e.g. windstorm, earthquake), but also the secondary perils associated with the primary peril. For example, storm surge as well as demand surge or loss amplification should be associated with tropical cyclone as appropriate. Fire following earthquake, sprinkler leakage and demand surge or loss amplification should be associated with earthquake as appropriate."/>
66.	The segmentation is the following:
67.	Natural catastrophe
- a. Tropical cyclone, hurricane, typhoon
- b. Extra-tropical windstorm / winter-storm
- c. Earthquake
  - i. Other material natural perils such as:
  - ii.	Flood
  - iii.	Tornado, hail, convective storms
  - iv.	Other risks
68.	Other catastrophe scenarios
- a. Terrorist attack
- b. Pandemic
- c. Credit and surety

### 2.3.3	Calibration
#### 2.3.3.1	Use of natural catastrophe models as part of the standard method
69.	For the risk assessment of natural catastrophe, the ICS allows the use of stochastic catastrophe models (vendor or proprietary) to calculate the loss amounts resulting from natural catastrophe events.
70.	During the development of the ICS, loss amounts related to natural catastrophe were requested for different confidence levels and different measures (VaR and Tail-VaR). Volunteer IAIGs were also asked to report qualitative information regarding the catastrophe model used as well as how the model was used.
71.	Allowing the use of natural catastrophe models as part of the standard method is perceived as an appropriate approach leveraging on scientific risk assessment methodologies, embedded in such models, and aligning the risk assessment with generally recognised market practices.
72.	To ensure the appropriateness of the models used, the ICS embeds safeguards about the quality of the model themselves but also about how those are used by IAIGs.

#### 2.3.3.2	Man-made catastrophe scenarios
73.	The man-made catastrophe scenarios have been defined, in the context of the standard method, to support the measure the 99.5% VaR over one year for each individual IAIG.
74.	This involves a high degree of expert judgement and some simplifications acceptable for a standard method, focusing on achieving an appropriate level of comparability and accuracy while preserving a desirable level of simplicity and practicality. [The Lloyds Realistic Disaster Scenarios](https://www.lloyds.com/conducting-business/underwriting/realistic-disaster-scenarios)  were used as a basis to derive the ones embedded in the ICS.
75.	Also, one should note that the man-made catastrophe scenarios included for the purpose of the ICS have been selected based on their materiality. To do so, 2015 Field Testing requested loss amounts related to associated with natural catastrophes and the following man-made scenarios:
- a. a terrorist attack scenario;
- b. a liability catastrophe scenario;
- c. a pandemic scenario;
- d. a marine collision scenario;
- e. an aviation collision scenario; and
- f. a credit and surety scenario.
76.	The obtained breakdown of total Catastrophe risk charges in 2015 Field Testing results helped refine and simplify the methodology, as the marine and aviation collision scenarios proved not to be material compared to other scenarios.

|Perils|percentage of Tatal net loss as<br/>reported in 2015 Field Testing|
|--|:--:|
|Natural catastrophes|40.3%|
|Liability catastrophe|31.0%|
|Pandemic|14.8%|
|Terrorism|5.6%|
|Credit and surety|5.4%|
|Marine|1.6%|
|Aviation|1.3%|

#### 2.3.3.3	Diversification within Catastrophe risks
77.	The contribution to the Catastrophe risk charge and ultimately to the ICS capital requirement from other Catastrophe components of the risk charge are considerably reduced by the effect of diversification.
78.	For the purpose of calculating the Catastrophe risk charge, the other catastrophe scenarios are assumed to be mutually independent and independent of the natural catastrophe perils. Consequently, the total ICS Catastrophe risk charge is calculated as follows:
- $ICS_{cat} = \sqrt{ICS_{NatCat}^2 + ICS_{Terror}^2 + ICS_{Pand}^2 + ICS_{credit}^2}$
